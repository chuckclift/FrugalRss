<title>3 mobile games that help you get things done</title><article>Tools to get the job don
Let’s face it: some of the tasks we do every day are pretty mundane. Maybe even downright boring. Yet, we still have to do them. Whether it’s checking email and making sure we’ve responded to all of the appropriate messages, or remembering to write that daily report every single day, there’s a lot of stuff do to. But staying motivated to complete even the most tedious of tasks doesn’t have to be a chore in itself. Here are three apps that make it downright fun.
It may not look like much, but that simple green dot is the start of what should be a very long chain, representing plenty of completed tasks.
You may not think a simple string of green dots could motivate you to get things done. But that just means you’re not familiar withWonderful Da, a 99-cent iOS app.
In some ways, Wonderful Day isn’t all that different from you basic task manager or to-do list app. It lets you add a list of tasks or activities, lets you tell the app how often you’d like them done – every day, every Monday, every weekday, or something similar. You also can tell the app what time of day the activity needs to be done, and set a reminder if you need one.
Once the task is complete for the day, you check it off in the app, and you begin building a chain of green dots. The goal is to keep building the chain without breaking it, with the idea that the more often you do something, the more likely it is to become a habit. And while green dots don’t sound terribly motivating, they actually are when you look at them – especially when you see a lengthy chain that you don’t want to break. Wonderful Day also awards medals when you create a lengthy chain.
Wonderful Day is not designed for one-off tasks, so it won’t motivate you to finish that massive year-end report. But it’s very easy – and fun! – to use, so if you’re looking for a simple way to stay on top of those daily to-dos, Wonderful Day is for you.
HabitRPG’s graphics are basic, but they don’t detract from the fun of playing the game.
If building a chain of green dots doesn’t sound like enough of a game for you,HabitRP may be just what you need. This free app for Android and iOS (with a Web version, too), turns your entire life into a game. And yes, it can help you become more productive along the way.
HabitRPG lets you add habits (both good and bad), daily tasks (called “Dailies”), and to-dos. Doing so is easier on the Web version than it is on the mobile app, which isn’t as intuitive. When you complete one of your good items, HabitRPG rewards you with experience, which allows you to level up in the game, and gold, which you can use to purchase items from the app or from your own list of rewards. The in-app rewards are items like swords for your avatar, which can give you a boost in the game, or items that you choose, like taking a break to play another video game. If you complete a bad habit – and own up to it – you damage the health of your avatar, a primitive looking figure you can customize to your liking.
HabitRPG can boost your productivity if you follow its rules, but setting it up and remembering to mark off the items you do or don’t complete can be something of a time suck. Its graphics are rudimentary, so sophisticated game players may be turned off, too. But it’s simple enough to use and offers a fun way to stay on top of all those boring tasks you need to complete.
SaveUp has plenty of fun prizes up for grabs, including a chance at its $2 million jackpot.
Saving money. It’s something we all should be doing, whether we’re trying to pay down a debt or launch a new business. But, honestly, it’s just not all much fun.Saveu, a free iOS app, tries to make it more enjoyable by rewarding you for making good financial decisions.
To use Saveup, you link your various financial accounts, from credit cards to mortgage loans and savings accounts. I found this process simple, as Saveup included direct links for adding accounts from national banks, like Chase and Bank of America, as well as those from small banks, like the one down the street from my house. When you make a smart financial decision, such as paying down a credit card or putting money in a 401K account, Saveup rewards you with credits. You earn 1 credit for every $2 paid to a credit card or every $1 added to your savings. You also earn credits for adding accounts and watching educational videos.
Once you earn enough credits, you can exchange them for a chance to win various prizes, which include items like store and restaurant gift cards, money, and even cars and vacations. The games you play to win the prizes, which typically include revealing digital cards and looking for matches, feel a lot like you’re playing a scratch lottery ticket, albeit virtually. They’re fun, but they do seem slightly out of place in an app that’s touting financial responsibility. Still, Saveup is easy to use and it makes saving money seem fun and exciting.Liane Cassavoy is a veteran technology and business journalist.

           When it comes to protecting critical networks, such as those running  power stations and other industrial systems, an air gap is still "a very  good idea", according to Eugene Kaspersky, founder of Kaspersky Lab --  and it's cheapTraditionally, an air gap was when the network containing critical  industrial systems and the SCADA systems that control them -- including  the (typically) Windows workstations used by the operators -- are  communicating via a network that is physically separate from the  internetE-CommercGovernmenInnovatioNBTelcoThese days, though, critical networks often have some sort of internet  connectivity, perhaps to route the monitoring and control traffic to  remote sites. Ideally, such connectivity is strictly limited to the  control trafficEither way, non-control data could still find its way into the critical networks, and this must be prevented"Engineers, they are bringing the new updates, the new versions of the  software, so they bring USB memory, notebooks, maybe CDs," Kaspersky  told the AusCERT 2015 Information Security Conference on the Gold Coast  on Thursday"Don't let them bring their data from outside to inside on the same memory. Make an air gap on a different operating system.If the engineers travel with notebook computers running Windows, for  example, then copy the software updates from those computers to a Linux  or OS X machine, and then to the memory device that will ultimately  transfer the data to the critical network"This air gap will block 99.99 percent of all known and future attacks --  it's not expensive. Maybe a couple of IT guys. Why a couple? Because  one of them could be sick or on vacation," Kaspersky said"It doesn't guarantee 100 percent of protection, because if they really  want to attack such a system, they will design Windows-Linux malware,  which infects both, so anyway it will travel through this protection.  It's more expensive to develop such malware. It's more risk to be  recognised. But the air gap will be a very good improvement for the  system, more close to the perfect security."

  Kaspersky's definition of perfect security is when a system is protected  so well that an attack must cost more than the potential damage to the  target"Negative return on investment, simple. And [by] the cost of the attack,  I don't mean just [the] money you need to pay for the engineers to  design this attack. I also mean political attribution risks -- to be  found, arrested, or attributed and real cruise missiles will be sent  back to the source of the attack," Kaspersky said"So the power plant must be protected so well from [cyber attacks] that  it's less expensive to send a cruise missile to destroy it.Another inexpensive technique is to put a filter device running a secure  operating system between the SCADA controller and the device it  controls. That device can intercept commands that don't pass a reality  check"For example, don't let SCADA change the speed of a turbine, to protect  the turbine from resonance. Easy," Kaspersky said. Or don't allow gas  pressure changes outside pre-set limits"Of course the SCADA has these controls itself, but it can be hacked,  and the extra filters placed on the secure operating system will protect  turbines from the most dangerous scenarios.

While the X-series is supposed to target the higher end (dubbed &quot;eXtreme Performance&quot;), the P-line is aimed at the budget mid-range (&quot;Premium Performance&quot; as MediaTek calls it). Today&#39;s announcement of the Helio P10 marks the first SoC in the P-series to adopt the new branThe P10 is the direct successor to last year&#39;s MT6752, which saw some quite widespread in adoption by Chinese vendors such as Meizu (M1 note), Gionee (Elife S7) or JiaYu (S3) and others.

Unlimited data is basically a thing of the past. Even if you're lucky (read: persistent) enough to still have a grandfathered-in plan from 2011. Most "unlimited" plans arethrottle after a certain point, which means that once you hit around 5GB of data usage you can expect your connection speed to slow down considerablyBut that's totally cool, right? Because,as Verizon Wireless say…you don't really want unlimited data. After all, you, like, have Wi-Fi at home, rightSeriously, you don't want itYou don'tI mean itHere's why&gt…And you have Wi-Fi everywhere, right? That's why you have a smartphone in the first place—so you can take advantage of all the free, speedy Wi-Fi in your city./sarcaIn the case of throttling, this is actually true. When you pay for 10GB of data, you get 10GB of un-throttled data – unlike when you pay for "unlimited" data and get just 5GB of un-throttled dataIf you had unlimited data, you'd constantly be streaming Spotify. And Spotify hurts musicians, which is why you're glad you don't have unlimited data…and you're definitely switching toTida when you have a moment. Right??Only about five percent of data users eat through more than 5GB/month. You're not part of this five percent, mostly because your limited data plan caps out at 4GB, and you don't want to pay overage charges. So, uh, you obviously don'tnee unlimited data"Hey Mom, I can't chat right now because I'm using too much data," sounds way better than, "Hey Mom…I'd rather sit here and stare at the wall than talk about your neighbor's new fence.Kidding!

           Take a risk and listen to your customers, Michael Gillespie, chief digital officer for Domino's Pizza told the ThoughtWorks Live conference on Thursday, "It's about thinking differently and pushing boundaries. ..It's about being hungry." In the first quarter this year, Domino's reported a record net profit of AU$29.1 million, up 44.2 percent from the same period last yearE-CommercGovernmenInnovatioNBTelco In "doughnating" his insights into the success of Domino's in the digital realm, Gillespie said that in order to succeed, companies need to embrace startup thinking"Learn what makes those startups special and keep that aggressive innovative thinking. Make people want to use you"We've remembered our core; we've just used digital as a method to enhance that experience and delivery of our core product, which has evolved "Pretty much any electronic device that you can access the internet from, you can order a Domino's pizza," he said Listing Domino's social media platforms, Gillespie said that wherever a Domino's customer wants to be in a digital space, they are there with them"We are also there in an offline capacity; you can still walk into a Domino's store," he said"Right now, well over 50 percent of our sales are on digital, some stores are very high [in digital sales], and over half of our digital sales are on mobile."

   In 2006 Domino's made a breakthrough in the fast food digital space -- they saw a way they could share their real-time data collection with their customer, and created the pizza tracker, which was available on its desktop viewed website. "Once you made that order, you could not stay on the phone for 15-20 minutes for that order to be fulfilled," Gillespie said. "But with technology we could take existing data we had and put a nice little interface on it -- and that's the pizza tracker. Domino's took the problem, 'Where is my pizza?', and used technology to provide the answer. Three years later, Domino's launched their mobile application, allowing customers to visualise their pizza before they ordered it. "I've been in the industry for a long time, but I would really struggle to talk up a pizza verbally. You want to see the picture, you want to see steam, you want to see a slice, you want to see all that sexiness that the pizza has," the CDO said. Within two months of the app's iPhone launch in 2009, Domino's generated over AU$1 million in revenue, Gillespie said In July last year, Domino's launched acrowd sourced project, Pizza Mogu, allowing customers to either create a pizza from 1.4 million different variations on its online ordering system, rename, or change any existing pizzas on the menu, and share the pizza on their own social media network. As a reward for each sale, people earned between 25 cents to AU$4.50 per pizza, and, as two teenagers from Toowoomba who pocketed AU$55,000 from the venture found out, it became a popular way for customers to make some dough.  Earlier this year, pizza delivery received its biggest shake up with the arrival of theDomino's GPS Driver Tracke. In partnership with Navman Wireless, Domino's launched the tracker to allow delivery drivers to be tracked via GPS when en route to making a delivery.  Just over a month since the launch of the Domino's app on the Apple Watch, Gillespie said that the move into this space was about empowering the early adopters of the wearable technology"It's about that 'wow' moment when they can see that their pizza is ready in store on their watch, without having to find their phone," he said"What comes next? Well I know what comes next -- at least I hope I do -- but, I could come back in 12 months and I bet you 30 percent of that will be completely different to what we expect. We've seen the customers change the way they want to engage with us, we're seeing new platforms launch, and various other digital disruptions that we need to respond to -- and be there firstPowered by LivefyHardwaHands-on: Protect your Apple Watch with the Speck CandyShell Fit covMobiliTop Windows Phone news of the week: Wunderlist, Cherry Mobile phones, Nokia $20 phoMobiliTop iOS news of the week: iPhone trade in, hack fix, Apple Watch in storMobiliTop Android news of the week: ZenWatch 2, M preview, Android keyboa© 2015 CBS Interactive.

<title>Trying To Benchmark The MIPS Creator CI20 With Debian Linux</title><article>Last year Imagination launcheda MIPS development boar that wenton sale at the end of last yea. In not seeing any significant benchmarks or performance coverage from this MIPS Creator CI20 over the past few months, I finally got around to buying one of these MIPS development boards from Imagination Technology. While the CI20 seemed promising at first, so far I'm very unhappy with this board and it's been even less stable than the Imagination PowerVR drivers on Linux going back to the Poulsbo The MIPS Creator CI20 retails for $65 and features the Ingenic JZ4780 SoC, which packs in a 1.2GHz dual-core MIPS 32-bit processor with PowerVR SGX540 graphics. The MIPS Creator comes preloaded with Debian 7 while Android 4.4 and other distributions are available: Gentoo, Yocto, Angstrom,With the Ingenic JZ4780 SoC is 8GB of flash storage, 1GB of DDR3 system memory, 10/100M Ethernet, 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, HDMI output, dual USB 2.0, 14-pin ETJAG connector, and various other expansion heaI finally got around to ordering the MIPS Creator CI20 after not seeing any review/test samples from Imagination and being curious about the modern MIPS Linux experience and performance.

<title>Microsoft Announces That Windows 10 Will Launch On July 29</title><article>Today Microsoft formally announced the release date for Windows 10, the latest version of their Windows operating system. Up until this point, all Microsoft had said was that they were aiming for a summer release. Today&#39;s post on the official Windows blog states the release date for Windows 10 has now been set for July 29, less than two months from nowAccording to the blog post, Microsoft will be simultaniously launching Windows 10 around the globe to some 1.5 billion Windows users that currently reside in over 190 different countries, making it the widest Windows has ever been released at once. Windows 10 is Microsoft&#39;s chance to win back users who didn&#39;t embrace the changes made in Windows 8, and they have a lot riding on its success. Offering it as a free upgrade&nbsp;to existing Windows users will certainly help in gaining adoptionEven with the free nature of the upgrade, the promise of a July release date for such a monumental update is quite a bold move on Microsoft&#39;s part. The less than optimal state of the current Windows 10 testing builds means that Microsoft has a great deal of work ahead of them as they squash bugs and improve the stability of Windows 10 in the two months between now and release. As a user who is keen on upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, I really hope theyFinally, Microsoft has revealed a few more details about how Windows 10 distribution will work. Starting today,users can &quot;reserve&quot; Windows 10 on Windows 7/8.1 machine. Reserving Windows will in turn flag a machine for pre-loading, with Microsoft distributing most of Windows 10 ahead of time as to get it in to customers&#39; hands more quickly to better balance the expected load on their server backend. According toMicrosoft&#39;s FA, reserving/pre-loading Windows 10 only downloads it, and users will still manually confirm the installation, or for that matter users can cancel the reservation entirely. Pre-loading has not started yet, and while Microsoft doesn&#39;t say when it will start, I expect it won&#39;t be until very near July 29thAlong with detailing the reservation process, Microsoft has also confirmed the upgrade paths for various versions of Windows. As expected, all Pro/Ultimate versions of Windows 7 and 8.1 will get upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, while all other versions of desktop/tablet Windows will get upgraded to Windows 10 Home. And of course, Windows Phone 8.1 devices will upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile

           People lodging claims online with Centrelink should be able to track their claim like they would track ordering a pizza from Domino's, according to the Department of Human ServicesIn theFederal Budget this yea, the department scored AU$60.5 million for the first so-called tranche of the replacement of the agency's legacy welfare payments systemE-CommercGovernmenInnovatioNBTelcoThe decades-old system in place today is used to process family support payments, letters, income assessments, and other notifications for around 100 programs, undertaking more than 50 million transactions dailyThe replacement of the whole system is a project titled "Welfare Payments Infrastructure Transformation", or known as "Whip It" internally. It is expected to take seven years in total, but the first tranche will be planning, scoping, and design work, and adding some initial "bolt-on" digital services for welfare recipientsDepartment of Human Services Secretary Kathryn Campbell told a Budget Estimates hearing on Wednesday that while the department prepares to go to market, a decision was made to seek to deliver new services to the public in the first 18 months to improve what services the department can today"One of the lessons we learned from a range of large transformation programs is you have to get on and deliver as well as rebuild the systems.We will deliver a range of digital enhancements during tranche 1," she saidTam Shepherd, acting executive director of the Welfare Payments Infrastructure Transformation Program said that one of the first changes will be for customers to see the status of a claim, more than the "submitted" and "processed" statuses today. He said it would be similar to how the Domino's online ordering app work"You order the pizza, you see it has been submitted, you see someone is cooking it, and you see it has been delivered," he saidHe said users that were interacting with Centrelink online were also wanting to stay online, and for that reason, the agency would also be looking to implement "click to chat" so "you're actually talking to an operator in a smart centre", rather than calling the Centrelink hotline when stuck with an online transactionCampbell said it would drive uptake of digital services.

  "That's what everybody else does. That's what Qantas does, that's what Telstra does. If we can keep people on digital channels, they'll continue to use them," she saidFewer than 100 staff are working on the project now, but that will grow over time. Shepherd indicated that it would be a mix of public sector employees and contractors"During the business case phase of the program... it was pretty clear that was a blended team of public servants who know [social security] very well, public servants who know our business very well, and experts who understand building large ICT systems, and experts who know how to procure those," he saidOnce the first tranche is underway, Campbell said the department will go back to government for funding for the remaining four tranches of the project once the business case has been developed"We would expect to go back to government in 18 months, with the business case, and ask for more money, and that money would be appropriated at that time," she said"We need to go to market to determine those costings. The estimates may be commercial-in-confidence.Despite seeking more funding for the project, Campbell said the department had projected savings of $44 million and $64 million in the last two forward years due to savings in IT and processes"We looked at what efficiencies were likely to come from these programs we were putting in place," Campbell said"We looked at how these strategies would produce benefits in our operations.Human Services Minister Marise Payne said that the business case would not be made public because it was a Cabinet documentThe agency has recently faced criticism overan Auditor-General's repor stating the average wait time to speak to Centrelink was over 16 minutesA 2012 agreement signed with Telstra for AU$474 million had yet to reap benefits for the call centre, but Grant Tidswell, deputy secretary for the department said that while the deal won't reduce demand, it will help manage demand"This is one of our great opportunities for us to manage telephony traffic in the country. We hope by this calendar year, we'll have the capability to move calls around the entire network, and I'll have 15,000 handsets to be able to distribute calls to," he said"On top of that we've built a distribution system to parcel up and move the work around, and we're now in the process of working with our partner provider Telstra to schedule those 15,000 staff in terms of the work and activity. It gives us the chance to move the work.. around the country. It will mean improved management in terms of demand"I don't think we've ever said it will reduce demand, but it will give us a chance to manage that demand in a much more coordinated way than we do now.Department CIO Gary Sterrenberg said that in the first three months of this year, the agency had just two "priority one" systems failures that meant customers were not able to access services for a period of time.

<title>Corsair unleashes the Bulldog DIY 4K Gaming PC</title><article>Corsair certainly is a company that is not afraid of diversification and has proved that multiple times in the past. They started as a memory products manufacturer, diversified into the power, case and cooling market segments and today they even have their own gaming divisionWith a company as active as Corsair is, their latest move was no surprise to us. Corsair combined their knowledge of chassis design and thermal performance, used their industry contacts and brought about the creation of the Bulldog, a DIY 4K Gaming PC designed to fit into living roomsThe Bulldog is the combination of a desktop PC case styled to appear as a gaming console with a 600W SFX power supply, a liquid cooler for the CPU and an ITX motherboard. Corsair&#39;s aim was to reduce a very high performance gaming PC to fit within the dimensions of a gaming console. In order to do that, they managed to fit dual liquid cooling systems (one for the CPU and, optionally, one for the GPU) and a high output SFX PSU into the desktop chassis. In terms of size, the Bulldog is relatively small but not too small, as it had to be tall enough for a high-end graphics card to The base configuration of the Bulldog includes the case, the ITX motherboard, the H5SF CPU liquid cooler and the 600W SFX power supply. It starts with a MSRP of $399, which seems a little steep at first but it is not really overpriced considering the specs of the motherboard. We are not aware of very specific details regarding the motherboard that is installed in the Bulldog, but it will support DDR4 RAM, USB 3.1, 7.1 audio, Gigabit Ethernet and WiFi. (It&#39;s worth noting that at this point, the only mini-ITX motherboard that can support DDR4 is the ASRock X99E-ITX, but in the pictures provided by Corsair the board used seems to be a DDR3 based ASUS. It doesn&#39;t take much to pinpoint that the Bulldog is mostly likely aimed for a future DDR4 capable platform, or currently just for the ASRock motherboard if Corsair wishes to pursue the DDR4 route exclusively.)&nbsp;Corsair has also collaborated with NVIDIA and MSI to create drop-in ready liquid cooled variations of the Geforce GTX Titan X, GTX 980, GTX 980 Ti and GTX 970.

          Corsair certainly is a company that is not afraid of diversification and has proved that multiple times in the past. They started as a memory products manufacturer, diversified into the power, case and cooling market segments and today they even have their own gaming divisionWith a company as active as Corsair is, their latest move was no surprise to us. Corsair combined their knowledge of chassis design and thermal performance, used their industry contacts and brought about the creation of the Bulldog, a DIY 4K Gaming PC designed to fit into living roomsThe Bulldog is the combination of a desktop PC case styled to appear as a gaming console with a 600W SFX power supply, a liquid cooler for the CPU and an ITX motherboard. Corsair&#39;s aim was to reduce a very high performance gaming PC to fit within the dimensions of a gaming console. In order to do that, they managed to fit dual liquid cooling systems (one for the CPU and, optionally, one for the GPU) and a high output SFX PSU into the desktop chassis. In terms of size, the Bulldog is relatively small but not too small, as it had to be tall enough for a high-end graphics card to The base configuration of the Bulldog includes the case, the ITX motherboard, the H5SF CPU liquid cooler and the 600W SFX power supply. It starts with a MSRP of $399, which seems a little steep at first but it is not really overpriced considering the specs of the motherboard. We are not aware of very specific details regarding the motherboard that is installed in the Bulldog, but it will support DDR4 RAM, USB 3.1, 7.1 audio, Gigabit Ethernet and WiFi. (It&#39;s worth noting that at this point, the only mini-ITX motherboard that can support DDR4 is the ASRock X99E-ITX, but in the pictures provided by Corsair the board used seems to be a DDR3 based ASUS. It doesn&#39;t take much to pinpoint that the Bulldog is mostly likely aimed for a future DDR4 capable platform, or currently just for the ASRock motherboard if Corsair wishes to pursue the DDR4 route exclusively.)&nbsp;Corsair has also collaborated with NVIDIA and MSI to create drop-in ready liquid cooled variations of the Geforce GTX Titan X, GTX 980, GTX 980 Ti and GTX 970. Combinations of the Corsair H55 liquid AIO cooler and the HG10 graphics card cooling bracket may also be Corsair&#39;s timing with that release seems perfect, as the first few graphics cards that can borderline handle 4K gaming are just hitting the market.

<title>The Kaveri Refresh &#39;Godavari&#39; Review: Testing AMD&#39;s A10-7870K</title><article>Astute readers will recognize that we recently posted two reviews covering more of the stack of AMD processors with the codename &#39;Kaveri&#39; which covered theA6-7400,A8-7650 and theA10-7700 in our recent coverage. Today we review the newest element that sits on top of all others, the A10-7870K Kaveri Refresh APURumors regarding an update to AMDs APU line have been permeating through the technology media for some weeks. Some seemed true, others obviously false and almost all posted without verification (which is the point where we at AT would post). However all of them revolved around the notion that AMD needed to update Kaveri, and perhaps pointing fingers at the new Excavator cores in the laptop focused Carrizo would be part of the lineThe A10-7870K is not a permutation of Carrizo. It relies on the same Steamroller cores as Kaveri, hence the title &#39;Kaveri Refresh&#39;, and has the same underlying architecture as KaveriUltimately the A10-7870K is the same core and same architecture underneath, but with a few added benefits detailed below. When it comes to naming, a number of sites and publications within the media have called the new line &lsquo;Godavari&rsquo;, and where the name Godavari comes in to all this is down to AMD&#39;s internal codenames rather than anything put forward by marketing. We were told that any slides published with that name are usually aimed for internal AMD or B2B use, but that also the &lsquo;Kaveri Refresh&rsquo; indication was again, an internal codename. One could argue the merits in using either codename, and I&rsquo;m sure the &lsquo;Godavari&rsquo; moniker will run riot, although I think Kaveri Refresh more accurately describes the new APU launch and subsequent models to foAMD is launching one consumer APU to begin with, with more (both consumer and commercial) to follow in the coming weeks and months. The purpose of the A10-7870K is to show that AMD is working at improving the silicon process and is able to achieve more with the same. The home hitting statistic from the new APU is a jump in clock speeds compared to the previous king of APUs, the A10-7850KThe bottom line is a bump in base frequency to 3.9GHz and turbo frequency to 4.1GHz giving more grunt in common tasks. The bigger jump, and arguable the more important, is the integrated graphics.&nbsp; We move from 720 MHz to 866 MHz, a boost of 20% on the 512SP core. With AMDs heterogeneous system architecture approach on the APU line, this is arguably the best place to put any potential increases due to process improvements and better binning. When speaking to AMD, it transpires that this boost on the Kaveri design is due to three things: an improved process, binning, and a marginal voltage increase (which is doubly effective due to the binning). The stock voltage of the processor goes up 0.050 volts compared to the 7850K, although AMD still reports a 95W TDP. Usually stock voltages are listed as a range depending on the quality of the die, but on average that window is slightly higher this time around. But as the TDP is similar, this ultimately should not matter that much. We have our power testing later in this reviewGoing back to the A10-7850K, at launch it was listed as $172, designed to compete with Intel but provide better integrated graphics (or APU + dGPU combo) for the similar budget. The price of the 7850K has come down since then, and currently resides at $135. As a result, the release price of the A10-7870K is suited to this new scale, and we should see it on the shelves for $143. If we compare that directly to an Intel part, we come up against the i3-4360 or i5-4570Our previous benchmark numbers show that in pure CPU workloads, AMDs architecture has a tough time in single threaded loads that do not rely on memory. Multithreaded loads also seem to take advantage of the hyperthreads of Intel better than the core design of the Bulldozer base architecture, although some benchmarks and workloads (particularly those that can be accelerated with the internal graphics) favor AMD. Where AMD pulls ahead is typically on the graphics side with the integrated solution of 512 SPs getting better frame rates in both regular and high end titles against a 24/20 execution unit Intel variant. Based on paper alone, the 20% boost in frequency to the 7870K would further cement that lead. However 20% clock speed does not guarantee 20% more performance, especially as top titles are becoming more multithreaded and/or memory bandwidth intensivePerhaps because of this, it is worth noting that AMD&rsquo;s sampling strategy for the A10-7870K was oriented more towards the gaming press than the technology press this time around, and as a result many of the tech websites had to find other sampling sources. AMD&rsquo;s slides on the Kaveri Refresh launch were, as expected, oriented towards some of the more e-Sports titles currently harvesting millions of players worldAMD&rsquo;s strategy at this point is simply that discrete cards go after AAA titles while the APU line grapples with games appealing to a more mass market, or mass audience. The key line in the promotional material we received was all about how an inexpensive system can tackle the common adversarial titles of the generationNot to focus all on the eSports titles, we did get a small glimpse into dual graphics compatibiAMD reported a 25% increase in frame rates even when moving from medium to high quality with DIRT Rally when enabling an R7 250 card into the mix for dual graphics. We&rsquo;ve tested dual graphics in this review as well, with titles like GRID Autosport, to find the parallels and verification for this. Because it&rsquo;s a question that comes up with almost every APU review, we asked for clarification on dual graphics compatibility with the A10 line of APUs. The results areSuggested: A10 APU + R7 250 DDR
Also works: A10 APU + R7 250 GDDR3 / R7 240 DDR3 / R7 240 GDDRAMD suggests DDR3 cards over GDDR3 cards purely to keep memory types similar, although at some point it would be interesting to see the comparison between the different types. For our testing we are using the R7 240 DDR3 model from ASUS, a small $70 discrete cardAnother element AMD is promoting with the Kaveri Refresh line is an upcoming feature in DirectX 12: Multiadapter Rendering / Asymmetric Rendering. DirectX 11 only allows single threaded operation by default with alternate frame rendering, by comparison. The principle behind asymmetric rendering means that each graphics adapter in the system can be identified by its speed and capabilities and assigned an appropriate identifier. Then, at the engine level of the game (making this feature title dependent, not driver dependent) batches of work can be dispatched according to priority, complexity and required efficiency to each of the rendering capable devices in the system. The results are collated into the graphics ouThe example we were given (which I have seen in the flesh) is with the Oxide Games/Stardock upcoming title Ashes of the Singularity. I spoke extensively to Dan Baker of Oxide Games and he states that the concept is relatively simple making it easier for programmers to dive in, and implementing it into their engine for the game took some time but they found a substantial benefit. Ashes of the Singularity is designed to be a more classical type of RTS based in the future, with plenty of units on hand as well as scenery and effects needing to be rendered. In the screenshot above, the red and blue colored items represent the different items that are rendered and the color shows which graphics in the system supplied the processing power. In this case the APU took care of the red units, while the discrete GPU did the scenery and a good portion of the effects. In the demo I was at, enabling the APU in this circumstance gave a 10% performance increase in a heavy 30 FPS scene to 33 FPS. It doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but any opportunity to use more of the system that the user has paid for is always a bonus. I asked regarding multiple discrete cards, such as dual R9 290Xs, and he said it wasn&rsquo;t a problem by the way they had built their engineWhile we do not have access to DX12 and Asymmetric Rendering capable titles as of yet, we are hoping to work closely with developers like Oxide in order to test the main public releases under the new feature sets. Stay tunedA new feature coming to the APU line, present on the high end graphics cards, is Virtual Screen ResoluSimilar to DSR, Virtual Screen Resolution is a driver level feature that allows the APU to render at a resolution higher than the monitor is capable and then scale the resulting image down to the actual screen resolution. Benefits include better aliasing, allowing both in-rendering algorithms and post-processing to essentially work on a larger image, as shown above. Obviously this comes at a price, namely performance. On the APU side it might be argued that VSR is not a great technology as typically people will game at lower resolutions anyway, or at 1080p with low/medium details while being limited around the 30 FPS barrier. The main plus point would be for devices that are resolution limited, say 720p, allowing them to render 1080p offscreen and then scale back inBack to the A10-7870K specifically, AMD is stating that due to the Kaveri Refresh nature of the SKU, it will be suited to all FM2+ capable sockets and motherboards that conform to AMD&rsquo;s specificatThat last bit is particularly important, based on information I received from one of the motherboard manufacturers that specifically released new motherboards for Kaveri Refresh. The motherboard manufacturer stated that they released new motherboards because the power draw for the graphics portion of the APU is now more substantial than before, and they wanted to implement an element of security into their products. Needless to say, it allows OEMs and system builders to provide a &lsquo;more up-to-date&rsquo; motherboard when providing systems around the A10-7870K, but AMD were quick to respond by saying words to the effect of &lsquo;any motherboard on the A88X/A78/A68H/A58 chipsets that use an FM2/FM2+ to our specifications will work with the Kaveri Refresh line&rsquo;. So there you goAs I mentioned at the top of the page, there are a number of supposed &lsquo;leaks&rsquo; floating around the internet recently, with a larger-than-normal proportion of them being obvious fakes in recent months (perhaps there&rsquo;s a sale on faked slides or something) and others being convincingly near the real thing without being confirmed by AMD. As a result, without direct confirmation from AMD, it&rsquo;s hard to say what is real or not. Some websites will be stating that one or two or more APUs were released at the same time as the A10-7870K, but we&rsquo;re only going to report here what we have been told directly by AMD in this instAt present, only the A10-7870K was officially launched on May 28th, and will retail in the channel for $137. OEM availability for the A10-7870K will be on June 2nd. Over the next few quarters, several more members will be added to the Kaveri Refresh family for both consumer and commercial, with a different naming scheme coming to the commercial side to account for generational updates to AMD&rsquo;s customers. The details of those models have not been officially released to the public, and personally I have only heard broad speculation or seen unconfirmed slide mockupsAs with our other APU coverage in recent weeks, we are taking the A10-7870K for a spin in both regular, office, professional and gaming tests as well as some basic overclocking. Unfortunately due to the timing we failed to finish the last one or two tests before travelling to Computex, but these results will be added to our database later in the month when we return. There&rsquo;s still over 100+ new data points for the A10-7870K to cover, and as usual the more modern tests results will be compared to here in the review but all the data points, including legacy and long-term benchmarks such as Cinebench 10 and POV-Ray, are in our benchmark databaseBench.

Thank you toRosewil for providing us withPSU andRK-9100 keyboardThose that have read my last couple of reviews would have noticed that we recently incorporated a pair of AMD R9 290X graphics cards into our CPU testing. These were kindly provided by the AMD UK/EU office in order to give us a comparison point for high-end AMD discrete performance. They supplied two of the MSI R9 290X 4GB Gaming LE models, which is one of the more cost effective R9 290X models allowing a full 2816 SPs per card. We are using these cards in our game testing and both of them in Crossfire when it comes to Shadows of Mordor iPower consumption was tested on the system while in a single NVIDIA GTX 770 configuration with a wall meter connected to the OCZ 1250W power supply. This power supply is Gold rated, and as I am in the UK on a 230-240 V supply, leads to ~75% efficiency &gt; 50W, and 90%+ efficiency at 250W, suitable for both idle and multi-GPU loading. This method of power reading allows us to compare the power management of the UEFI and the board to supply components with power under load, and includes typical PSU losses due to efficiencyWe are reporting the power consumption difference when idle and during an initial OCCT load. This is slightly skewed by the adjustment up the efficiency chain of our power supply, showing lower power CPUs consuming a little more, but despite this the qualitative comparison is a still a good place to staAt 117W in our test, it seems a little over the 95W TDP listed, especially when the 7850K achieved 85W and under its 95W TDP. There will be variation within a SKU based on the binning quality, as I doubt the average 0.050 volts added to this SKU as I was told by AMD accounts for this much. Perhaps we ended up with a good 7850K sample but a mediocre 7870K sample. Alas with 100 CPUs we might get a better histogram of performance here, but we rarely get more than a single uniAstute readers will recognize that we recently posted two reviews covering more of the stack of AMD processors with the codename &#39;Kaveri&#39; which covered theA6-7400,A8-7650 and theA10-7700 in our recent coverage. Today we review the newest element that sits on top of all others, the A10-7870K Kaveri Refresh APURumors regarding an update to AMDs APU line have been permeating through the technology media for some weeks. Some seemed true, others obviously false and almost all posted without verification (which is the point where we at AT would post). However all of them revolved around the notion that AMD needed to update Kaveri, and perhaps pointing fingers at the new Excavator cores in the laptop focused Carrizo would be part of the lineThe A10-7870K is not a permutation of Carrizo. It relies on the same Steamroller cores as Kaveri, hence the title &#39;Kaveri Refresh&#39;, and has the same underlying architecture as KaveriUltimately the A10-7870K is the same core and same architecture underneath, but with a few added benefits detailed below. When it comes to naming, a number of sites and publications within the media have called the new line &lsquo;Godavari&rsquo;, and where the name Godavari comes in to all this is down to AMD&#39;s internal codenames rather than anything put forward by marketing. We were told that any slides published with that name are usually aimed for internal AMD or B2B use, but that also the &lsquo;Kaveri Refresh&rsquo; indication was again, an internal codename. One could argue the merits in using either codename, and I&rsquo;m sure the &lsquo;Godavari&rsquo; moniker will run riot, although I think Kaveri Refresh more accurately describes the new APU launch and subsequent models to foAMD is launching one consumer APU to begin with, with more (both consumer and commercial) to follow in the coming weeks and months. The purpose of the A10-7870K is to show that AMD is working at improving the silicon process and is able to achieve more with the same. The home hitting statistic from the new APU is a jump in clock speeds compared to the previous king of APUs, the A10-7850KThe bottom line is a bump in base frequency to 3.9GHz and turbo frequency to 4.1GHz giving more grunt in common tasks. The bigger jump, and arguable the more important, is the integrated graphics.&nbsp; We move from 720 MHz to 866 MHz, a boost of 20% on the 512SP core. With AMDs heterogeneous system architecture approach on the APU line, this is arguably the best place to put any potential increases due to process improvements and better binning. When speaking to AMD, it transpires that this boost on the Kaveri design is due to three things: an improved process, binning, and a marginal voltage increase (which is doubly effective due to the binning). The stock voltage of the processor goes up 0.050 volts compared to the 7850K, although AMD still reports a 95W TDP. Usually stock voltages are listed as a range depending on the quality of the die, but on average that window is slightly higher this time around. But as the TDP is similar, this ultimately should not matter that much. We have our power testing later in this reviewGoing back to the A10-7850K, at launch it was listed as $172, designed to compete with Intel but provide better integrated graphics (or APU + dGPU combo) for the similar budget. The price of the 7850K has come down since then, and currently resides at $135. As a result, the release price of the A10-7870K is suited to this new scale, and we should see it on the shelves for $143. If we compare that directly to an Intel part, we come up against the i3-4360 or i5-4570Our previous benchmark numbers show that in pure CPU workloads, AMDs architecture has a tough time in single threaded loads that do not rely on memory. Multithreaded loads also seem to take advantage of the hyperthreads of Intel better than the core design of the Bulldozer base architecture, although some benchmarks and workloads (particularly those that can be accelerated with the internal graphics) favor AMD. Where AMD pulls ahead is typically on the graphics side with the integrated solution of 512 SPs getting better frame rates in both regular and high end titles against a 24/20 execution unit Intel variant. Based on paper alone, the 20% boost in frequency to the 7870K would further cement that lead. However 20% clock speed does not guarantee 20% more performance, especially as top titles are becoming more multithreaded and/or memory bandwidth intensivePerhaps because of this, it is worth noting that AMD&rsquo;s sampling strategy for the A10-7870K was oriented more towards the gaming press than the technology press this time around, and as a result many of the tech websites had to find other sampling sources. AMD&rsquo;s slides on the Kaveri Refresh launch were, as expected, oriented towards some of the more e-Sports titles currently harvesting millions of players worldAMD&rsquo;s strategy at this point is simply that discrete cards go after AAA titles while the APU line grapples with games appealing to a more mass market, or mass audience. The key line in the promotional material we received was all about how an inexpensive system can tackle the common adversarial titles of the generationNot to focus all on the eSports titles, we did get a small glimpse into dual graphics compatibiAMD reported a 25% increase in frame rates even when moving from medium to high quality with DIRT Rally when enabling an R7 250 card into the mix for dual graphics. We&rsquo;ve tested dual graphics in this review as well, with titles like GRID Autosport, to find the parallels and verification for this. Because it&rsquo;s a question that comes up with almost every APU review, we asked for clarification on dual graphics compatibility with the A10 line of APUs. The results areSuggested: A10 APU + R7 250 DDR
Also works: A10 APU + R7 250 GDDR3 / R7 240 DDR3 / R7 240 GDDRAMD suggests DDR3 cards over GDDR3 cards purely to keep memory types similar, although at some point it would be interesting to see the comparison between the different types. For our testing we are using the R7 240 DDR3 model from ASUS, a small $70 discrete cardAnother element AMD is promoting with the Kaveri Refresh line is an upcoming feature in DirectX 12: Multiadapter Rendering / Asymmetric Rendering. DirectX 11 only allows single threaded operation by default with alternate frame rendering, by comparison. The principle behind asymmetric rendering means that each graphics adapter in the system can be identified by its speed and capabilities and assigned an appropriate identifier. Then, at the engine level of the game (making this feature title dependent, not driver dependent) batches of work can be dispatched according to priority, complexity and required efficiency to each of the rendering capable devices in the system. The results are collated into the graphics ouThe example we were given (which I have seen in the flesh) is with the Oxide Games/Stardock upcoming title Ashes of the Singularity. I spoke extensively to Dan Baker of Oxide Games and he states that the concept is relatively simple making it easier for programmers to dive in, and implementing it into their engine for the game took some time but they found a substantial benefit. Ashes of the Singularity is designed to be a more classical type of RTS based in the future, with plenty of units on hand as well as scenery and effects needing to be rendered. In the screenshot above, the red and blue colored items represent the different items that are rendered and the color shows which graphics in the system supplied the processing power. In this case the APU took care of the red units, while the discrete GPU did the scenery and a good portion of the effects. In the demo I was at, enabling the APU in this circumstance gave a 10% performance increase in a heavy 30 FPS scene to 33 FPS. It doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but any opportunity to use more of the system that the user has paid for is always a bonus. I asked regarding multiple discrete cards, such as dual R9 290Xs, and he said it wasn&rsquo;t a problem by the way they had built their engineWhile we do not have access to DX12 and Asymmetric Rendering capable titles as of yet, we are hoping to work closely with developers like Oxide in order to test the main public releases under the new feature sets. Stay tunedA new feature coming to the APU line, present on the high end graphics cards, is Virtual Screen ResoluSimilar to DSR, Virtual Screen Resolution is a driver level feature that allows the APU to render at a resolution higher than the monitor is capable and then scale the resulting image down to the actual screen resolution. Benefits include better aliasing, allowing both in-rendering algorithms and post-processing to essentially work on a larger image, as shown above. Obviously this comes at a price, namely performance. On the APU side it might be argued that VSR is not a great technology as typically people will game at lower resolutions anyway, or at 1080p with low/medium details while being limited around the 30 FPS barrier. The main plus point would be for devices that are resolution limited, say 720p, allowing them to render 1080p offscreen and then scale back inBack to the A10-7870K specifically, AMD is stating that due to the Kaveri Refresh nature of the SKU, it will be suited to all FM2+ capable sockets and motherboards that conform to AMD&rsquo;s specificatThat last bit is particularly important, based on information I received from one of the motherboard manufacturers that specifically released new motherboards for Kaveri Refresh. The motherboard manufacturer stated that they released new motherboards because the power draw for the graphics portion of the APU is now more substantial than before, and they wanted to implement an element of security into their products. Needless to say, it allows OEMs and system builders to provide a &lsquo;more up-to-date&rsquo; motherboard when providing systems around the A10-7870K, but AMD were quick to respond by saying words to the effect of &lsquo;any motherboard on the A88X/A78/A68H/A58 chipsets that use an FM2/FM2+ to our specifications will work with the Kaveri Refresh line&rsquo;. So there you goAs I mentioned at the top of the page, there are a number of supposed &lsquo;leaks&rsquo; floating around the internet recently, with a larger-than-normal proportion of them being obvious fakes in recent months (perhaps there&rsquo;s a sale on faked slides or something) and others being convincingly near the real thing without being confirmed by AMD. As a result, without direct confirmation from AMD, it&rsquo;s hard to say what is real or not. Some websites will be stating that one or two or more APUs were released at the same time as the A10-7870K, but we&rsquo;re only going to report here what we have been told directly by AMD in this instAt present, only the A10-7870K was officially launched on May 28th, and will retail in the channel for $137. OEM availability for the A10-7870K will be on June 2nd. Over the next few quarters, several more members will be added to the Kaveri Refresh family for both consumer and commercial, with a different naming scheme coming to the commercial side to account for generational updates to AMD&rsquo;s customers. The details of those models have not been officially released to the public, and personally I have only heard broad speculation or seen unconfirmed slide mockupsAs with our other APU coverage in recent weeks, we are taking the A10-7870K for a spin in both regular, office, professional and gaming tests as well as some basic overclocking. Unfortunately due to the timing we failed to finish the last one or two tests before travelling to Computex, but these results will be added to our database later in the month when we return. There&rsquo;s still over 100+ new data points for the A10-7870K to cover, and as usual the more modern tests results will be compared to here in the review but all the data points, including legacy and long-term benchmarks such as Cinebench 10 and POV-Ray, are in our benchmark databaseBench.

<title>Phoronix Test Suite 5.8 Furthers Phoromatic For Enterprise Benchmarking</title><article>Phoronix Test Suite 5.8 was released today as the latest quarterly update to Phoronix Media's open-source, cross-platform benchmarking and automated testing software. Beyond offering a significant number of new features, the Phoronix Test Suite 5.8 release commemorates seven years since the release of Phoronix Test Suite 1.0 and eleven years since the start of Phoronix.com in what's evolved to become the largest Linux hardware destination on the Interne5 June 2015 --Phoronix Medi has announced the immediate release ofPhoronix Test Suit 5.8 (codenamed &quot;Belev&quot;). Continuing in the work set by earlier Phoronix Test Suite 5.x quarterly releases, Phoronix Test Suite 5.8 adds a significant number of new features and improvements to thePhoromati component for automated benchmark orchestration, benchmark system management, and result analyticsPhoronix Test Suite 5.8 ships with the latest Phoromatic client and server code that's open-source under the same terms as the Phoronix Test Suite client, the GNU GPLv2. Phoromatic allows the automatic scheduling of tests, remote installation of new tests, and the management of multiple test systems all through an intuitive, easy-to-use web interface. Tests can be scheduled to automatically run on a routine basis across multiple test systems, whenever triggered via an external script, or in a one-off test run mode via benchmark tickets.

<title>Intel to Acquire FPGA-Specialist Altera for $16.7 Billion</title><article>Today Intel has announced that they are buying Altera in an all-cash deal of $16.7 billion. The deal, having been rumored for a while now, will see Intel pick up Altera for their Field Programmable Grid Array (FPGA) experience, with Intel intending to both continue FPGA development and integrate FPGAs into some of their future productsIn the FPGA space Altera is one of the two major competitors, and alongside rival Xilinx the two companies comprise the bulk of the market. Prior to this sale Altera already had a close relationship with Intel, with Altera using Intel&rsquo;s 14nm process for their latest generation of Stratix FAs one of only a few external companies known to be using Intel&rsquo;s 14nm process, Altera&rsquo;s FPGA&rsquo;s have been a natural complement to Intel&rsquo;s ASIC business. On a business side there&rsquo;s minimal overlap, but more importantly on the technical side FPGAs are good candidates for early production on a lower-yielding node. Since FPGAs are just large arrays of programmable logic and RAM, they can easily compensate for defects, allowing for a greater number of chips to be shipped for revenue early-on than a more complex ASICGiven Intel and Altera&rsquo;s already close working relationship, today&rsquo;s deal was not unexpected. Purchasing Altera allows Intel to bring their FPGA production entirely in-house, not just producing FPGAs but better aligning them to Intel&rsquo;s development plans as part of their integrated device manufacturing model. However more significantly, this gives Intel access to top-tier FPGA technology, which they can use to augment other productsIntel is already talking about the possibilities they see for Altera&rsquo;s FPGA technology in the IoT and datacenter markets, but also the company has confirmed that they will be integrating FPGA technology into some of their future Xeon products, to allow customers to essentially build-out semi-custom processors via the FPGA component. Intel already does on-package FPGAs for certain customers, so this would represent the logical extension of that process by bringing the FPGA fully onFor Intel this also represents a chance to further branch out in the markets they cover. The PC and server market has continued to treat the company well, even as PC sales have slowed, but having so far struggled to capture a major piece of the mobile space from ARM and its partners, Intel has been looking at other avenues of growth. In this case FPGAs represent a high-margin business on their own, one that&rsquo;s increasing in revenue as ASIC development costs continue to rise, and a good match for Intel given their traditional manufacturing advantage

<title>Yahoo axes Maps, Pipes, other services as it narrows focus</title><article>
Yahoo says it’s all aboutsearch, communications, and digital conten, and now a few of its older services must go. Caught up in Yahoo’s digital divide are people on aging iOS devices, some Mac OS X Lion users, fans of Yahoo Maps, and power users attached to Yahoo Pipes.
Yahoo says it can no longer service the built-in mail app for iOS 4 and earlier. Anyone running that system will have to turn to Yahoo Mail’s web app. The company says it is doing this “in order to maintain focus on the security, speed, and functionality of Yahoo Mail on the latest systems.”
Also on the outs is support for syncing Yahoo contacts on Macs running OS X 10.7 Lion devices and earlier. Mac owners with 10.7 and earlier will also have to turn to the web to access their contacts stored with Yahoo.
Yahoo Maps is also set to vanish, and pretty quickly too. The company plans to shut downmaps.yahoo.co at the end of June. Even though the public-facing site is going away Yahoo’s mapping efforts will remain alive for other purposes. Flickr will still have maps support after June and several other unnamed Yahoo properties will also keep maps integration.
Since 2007,Yahoo Pipe has been a convenient way to bring web content together. Based on the pipes concept from Unix-style command lines, Yahoo Pipes lets you createcustom RSS feeds from multiple website.
On August 30, Yahoo will no longer accept the creation of new Pipes, and a month later the service will stop working entirely. Anyone who uses Pipes will have until September 30, 2015, to get their data out.
Beyond those major changes, Yahoo also shut down a number of country-specific versions of its specialty websites, including Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Entertainment, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Music, and Yahoo TV. The U.S. versions of all five of these properties remain untouched, while Canada is losing Yahoo Music and Yahoo TV.The story behind the story For years, Yahoo has been a confusing company to watch.

<title>Antec Reveals the Signature S10 Premium Tower Case</title><article>That Antec designed a new case may not really sound like news. After all, cases are the primary focus of the company, which offers dozens of models. However, this particular release is of special interest as the company has overhauled their lineup with a new flagship case, the Signature S10, a unique tower case of massive proportions. Meant to be Antec&#39;s engineering pinnacle, the Signature S10 is an aggressive combination of advanced thermal performance, versatility, and elegant aestheticsMeasuring 60 cm tall and 59 cm deep (23.7&quot; &times; 23.2&quot;), the Signature S10 is one of the largest tower cases in existence. It also weights about 18 kg, making it a very heavy case that is certainly not designed for frequent movement. Still, the proportions of a case alone are not stimulating and not what is unique about this particular release. What is perhaps the most important point of the Signature S10 is that it features Antec&#39;s patented three chamber design internal architecExactly as the name suggests, the three chamber design architecture splits the interior of the Signature S10 into three compartments. The entire front of the case is reserved for hard disk drives, the bottom compartment is shared between the PSU and five 2.5&quot; device trays, and the primary compartment is reserved for the main system alone. Note that, despite its size, the Signature S10 does not have any 5.25&quot; drive bays, so the idea of an optical drive is truly dead for this case. However, there is a slot for a short 5.25&quot; device (fan controller, card reader, etc.). The chassis is most likely made out of SECC steel and the buyer is given the choice between aluminum and smoked tempered glass doors for the side panels. If Antec&#39;s press release is accurate and we are talking about real glass, not Plexiglass, that would be a sight to beAs the Signature S10 is intended to be Antec&#39;s engineering pinnacle, the stock cooling of the case is intense. The very architecture of the case is supposed to aid thermal performance, forcing top-down airflow. There are seven stock fans, five 120 mm and two&nbsp;140 mm, preinstalled into the Signature S10, the models and specifications of which are unknown at this point of time. To limit the insertion of dust, Antec installed micromesh air filters to each individual chamber. &Obviously, Antec is trying to combine the very elegant appearance of the Signature series with outstanding thermal performance and expandability options, pitching the case as a good match for advanced gaming systems and workstations. Meanwhile it seems as Antec put every bit of their technology on the Signature S10, and the retail price reflects that, as the MSRP is just shy of $500. Consequently the potential market of the Signature S10 is going to be very small (if not very elite) limited to the most hardcore of enthusiasts who are willing to pay a very hefty price in order to combine elegant aesthetics and quality with thermal performaGallery:Antec ReThat Antec designed a new case may not really sound like news.

<title>Android TV&#039;s 600 “new” apps are now much easier to find</title><article>
As promised last week, Google has made a major change to the Android TV app store, letting users browse every app instead of a tiny, curated collection.
Google says there are now 600 “new” apps in the Google Play Store for Android TV, though in reality many of these apps aren't new. They've just been hidden from the main storefront, so the only way to find them was to search by name.
The latest Play Store update lets you browse the full store without searching. Just scroll to the bottom of the screen, and select any category from the Apps or Games menus. You'll have to wade through a fair amount of junk, niche tools, and apps of questionable value, but there are some interesting finds if you're willing to hunt around. (I'm intrigued, for instance, bythis streaming U.K. TV ap andthis Instagram viewe.)
Google isn't abandoning curation, however. In fact, it's putting more effort into categorization by splitting its existing apps and games into more lists, around things like movies, TV, sports, platform games, and racing games. It's a bit more orderly than before, but also somewhat messier, because game and app categories are interspersed instead of being kept separate.
The update should be available now for all users of the Nexus Player, Nvidia Shield Android T, Forge TV, and smart televisions running Android TV.Why this matters The battle for living room set-top box supremacy is intensifying, with Amazon touting600 of its own app for Fire TV devices, and Apple reportedly working ona full app store for Apple T. Google is doing its part with some new content partners coming soo, while the expanded app store plays to Android's strength as an open platform. If you're the type that likes to trick out your TV box with tweaks and customizations, Android TV is starting to look more hospitable.Jared writes for PCWorld and TechHive from his remote outpost in CincinnatMore bJared NeUse commas to separate multiple email addresseYour message has been sentThere was an error emailing this pagHardcore Hardware: CyberPower Trinity Xtre

<title>Skype for web beta lets you ditch the desktop client</title><article>Skype is making it easier for users to ditch their desktop software, and use the Skype for Web beta insteadSkype for Web, which launched as a closed beta last fall, is now available as an open beta to all U.S. and U.K. users. It's similar to the desktop version, with support for messaging, audio calls, and video chats. You can also search your contact list to start new messages, or find new contacts by searching the Skype directory. It supports desktop notifications as wellThere are some differences from the desktop client, however. The web version doesn't have nearly as many options for sorting and managing your contact lists, and there doesn't seem to be any way to change your “mood.” Still, as a simple way to connect with your existing Skype contacts, it should get the job doneSetting up the web version of Skype does involve installing a plug-in if you want to conduct voice or video calls. For now, that means Chromebook users are limited to text messaging only. Skype has said that it's working on a WebRTC version of the web app, which wouldn't require a plug-in and would technically allow for Chromebook support, but there's no word on when that might happen.

           Both the Coalition and former Labor governments have been slammed by the Police Federation of Australia for delaying making a decision on whether to dedicate spectrum and provide funding for public safety mobile broadband networksThe Australian government has tasked theProductivity Commissio to scope out the possibility of building a national mobile broadband network exclusively for use by emergency service agencies, as one of three potential options to address the growing data needs of police, fire, and ambulance services out in the fieldE-CommercGovernmenInnovatioNBTelcoIn a submission to the commission from the Police Federation of Australia (PFA),  the organisation said it had lobbied governments for the past five years for public safety spectrum to be allocated without any decisive action from either the former Rudd-Gillard governments, or the Abbott government"It seems clear that governments are simply delaying action to resolve this issue in order to put off allocating funds to deliver mobile broadband communications for public safety,"PFA CEO Mark Burgess stated (PDF"Why else would public safety agencies be the only sector which is now required to undergo a cost-benefit analysis before securing spectrum for this purpose. No cost-benefit analysis has been required for the mining sector, the rail operators, defence, the telecommunications sector, or radio and television broadcasters to name a few.Burgess said it was "disgraceful" and against the public interest for the government to set a deadline of 2020 for public safety mobile broadbandThe organisation said it preferred a network owned by the agencies, but said it was open to a hybrid approach where commercial networks provide spill-over capacity when the dedicated network is at full capacityBurgess said that PFA would prefer emergency services to be allocated 20MHz of 700MHz or 800MHz spectrumThis is likely to face opposition from the commercial mobile network operators. Vodafone Australia, which didn't bid for 700MHz spectrum when it was first auctioned off, said it was "strongly opposed" to public safety agencies getting access to the lucrative left-over spectrum.

           Both the Coalition and former Labor governments have been slammed by the Police Federation of Australia for delaying making a decision on whether to dedicate spectrum and provide funding for public safety mobile broadband networksThe Australian government has tasked theProductivity Commissio to scope out the possibility of building a national mobile broadband network exclusively for use by emergency service agencies, as one of three potential options to address the growing data needs of police, fire, and ambulance services out in the fieldE-CommercGovernmenInnovatioNBTelcoIn a submission to the commission from the Police Federation of Australia (PFA),  the organisation said it had lobbied governments for the past five years for public safety spectrum to be allocated without any decisive action from either the former Rudd-Gillard governments, or the Abbott government"It seems clear that governments are simply delaying action to resolve this issue in order to put off allocating funds to deliver mobile broadband communications for public safety,"PFA CEO Mark Burgess stated (PDF"Why else would public safety agencies be the only sector which is now required to undergo a cost-benefit analysis before securing spectrum for this purpose. No cost-benefit analysis has been required for the mining sector, the rail operators, defence, the telecommunications sector, or radio and television broadcasters to name a few.Burgess said it was "disgraceful" and against the public interest for the government to set a deadline of 2020 for public safety mobile broadbandThe organisation said it preferred a network owned by the agencies, but said it was open to a hybrid approach where commercial networks provide spill-over capacity when the dedicated network is at full capacityBurgess said that PFA would prefer emergency services to be allocated 20MHz of 700MHz or 800MHz spectrumThis is likely to face opposition from the commercial mobile network operators. Vodafone Australia, which didn't bid for 700MHz spectrum when it was first auctioned off, said it was "strongly opposed" to public safety agencies getting access to the lucrative left-over spectrum.

<title>OCZ Announces Trion 100 TLC SSD &amp; Shows Off an Upcoming NVMe Drive with Toshiba Controller</title><article>One of the things I&#39;ve been expecting&nbsp;to see at this year&#39;s Computex is more TLC NAND based SSDs. So far only Samsung and SanDisk have been shipping TLC SSDs in high volume, but&nbsp;OCZ will shortly join the&nbsp;club with its Trion 100 SSD series that was showcased on the Computex showfloor. The Trion 100 is based on a totally in-house designed Toshiba &quot;Alishan&quot; controller, whereas some earlier Toshiba controllers have been&nbsp;modified/renamed third party silicons with the company&#39;s firmware. We discussed the cooperation between the two companies in more detailin our interview with OCZ&#39;s CEO, Ralph Schmitt but to put it shortly the use of Toshiba IP in an OCZ product is part of the companies&#39; strategy to consolidate product development to maximize resources as it wouldn&#39;t be efficient to have both companies working on platforms that ultimately have the same end goal.&nbspThe NAND in Trion 100 is Toshiba&#39;s A19nm (i.e. second generation 19nm) TLC, although OCZ is planning on switching to the latest 15nm node later this year once the supply is high enough. For error correction the drive uses Toshiba&#39;s own QSBC (Quadruple Swing-By Correction) technology, which from what I was told is basically in&nbsp;between traditional BCH and LDPC correction. I don&#39;t have too many details of the technology at this point, but I will try to gather more information to better know how the technology stacks up against the competition. Typical to TLC drives, the Trion 100 employs an SLC cache to increase peak performance in&nbsp;smaller capacities and also to boost endurance.&nbOne of the biggest improvements in the Trion 100 is the support for DevSleep and other power saving&nbsp;modes. Because of the silicon design the Barefoot 3 isn&#39;t capable of offering low idle power consumption, which has been one of main criticisms for a while now. With the Trion 100 OCZ is finally looking to provide a solution that&#39;s also suitable for mobile applications where power draw and battery life are major concernsThe Trion 100 is now&nbsp;in final validation and the official release will take place later in the summer. Hence performance, endurance and pricing are not final yet, but what I was told is that the performance will be read focused (as most light client&nbsp;workloads are read-centric), endurance goal is 20GB/day and price will be slightly below the ARCAside from the Trion 100, OCZ also showed off a new unannounced M.2 NVMe drive that will be released later this year (I&#39;m hearing&nbsp;September-October timeframe) as a new RevoDrive. Unlike the previous designs we have seen, this isn&#39;t based on OCZ&#39;s own JetExpress controller, but on Toshiba&#39;s PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe controller. The reason OCZ is using Toshiba&#39;s controller is&nbsp;cost because the the JetExpress has been designed mainly with enterprise in mind, meaning that it cannot be implemented into a cost effective client drive.&Obviously OCZ also had it&#39;s newZ-Drive 6000 serie on display along with the upcoming JetExpress based XD-JX serieOne of the things I&#39;ve been expecting&nbsp;to see at this year&#39;s Computex is more TLC NAND based SSDs.

<title>How to install Windows apps on an SD card or USB drive</title><article>
In the past few years, we’ve seen a wave of new inexpensive Windows tablets and laptops, starting with the release of Windows 8. But as you may have found out the hard way, these lower-end tablets and laptops usually offer little internal disk space: as low as 32GB and even 16GB in newer models. Since Windows and basic software can easily take up double-digits’ worth of gigabytes or more, there is typically little or no room left for extra applications, games, photos, documents, and other personal files.
Though you can usually pop in a MicroSD card or a flash drive to get more disk space, you won’t find a way in the graphical interface to have the modern-style Windows Store apps—which can consume a ton of disk space—install onto removable storage. However, it is possible with a registry hack in both Windows 8 and 8.1, giving you another way to help conserve your internal disk space.
When running apps off external storage like this, keep in mind you should try to use the fastest, highest performance SD card that’s supported by your device. Ensure you get the right-sized SD card as well. Most tablets take the small MicroSD cards, but not the larger, regular-sized SD cards.
If you prefer to use a USB flash drive for extra storage space, try to get one that supports USB 3.0, the fastest USB version yet. Also, consider a mini low-profile drive that doesn’t extend out of the USB port much, to prevent accidental damage when using or storing your device while the drive is inserted.
Though any SD card or flash drive should work for storing your Windows 8 apps, it needs to be in a certain file system format, called NTFS. To check yours, pop in the card or drive, open a File Explorer window, find your removable storage, right-click its icon (or long tap for touch screens), and selectPropertiesYou can see the File System listed near the top of the drive’s Properties window
If your card or drive isn’t in the NTFS format, you can easily change it. However, first ensure you have copied any existing files on that drive to another location before proceeding, as changing the format will delete all data on that drive.
Once you’ve backed up any existing files on the card or drive, you can format it by right-clicking the drive’s icon (or long taping for touch screens) and selectForma. On the Format dialog window, ensureNTF is selected for theFile Syste and that theQuick Forma checkbox near the bottom is selected, and then clickStar.Formatting your drive with the NTFS file system
Even if your drive is already formatted to NTFS, you may want to create a new folder on the drive that will hold the data for your Windows 8 apps. Simply open a File Explorer window, navigate to the drive, and create a folder, perhaps naming it “Windows Apps”, “Win8Apps”, or something else to help you identify it. Inside this folder, Windows will create a sub-folder for each app you install in the future.
In order to change the location where Windows 8 apps are installed, you must first give yourself (or more technically the Administrators of Windows) ownership and editing permissions of the corresponding registry key. To get started, open the Registry Editor: go to the Start Screen, type “regedi”, open the program in the search results, and follow these steps:
In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following location:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App
On the left side of the window, right-click theApp key (or long tap for touch screens) and clickPermissions.. and then.Accessing the Permissions of the Appx key
On the Permissions window, click theAdvance button.Accessing the Advanced Permissions of the Appx key
On the Advanced Security Settings dialog, click theChang link on top, next toTrustedInstalle.Opening the window to change ownership
Type “administrator into the box, clickCheck Name, and clickO.Changing ownership of the Appx key to Administrators
Near the top of the Advanced Security Settings dialog, select theReplace owner on subcontainers and objectscheckbox and clickO.Applying ownership changes to all settings of the Appx key
Back on th Permission window, select theAdministrator entry from the list, forFull Contro select theAllocheckbo, and clickO.Allowing full control of the Appx key
Back on the main Registry Editor window, double-click th PackageRoo entry on the right side of the window.Finally, here’s where you define the location where you want Windows 8 app data to reside
Type the location of the desired drive or folder you created earlier and clickO.In our example, we’re storing Windows 8 app data to a folder on the SD card, which is the E drive
Reboot your device to ensure the changes are applied.
The registry hack we discussed will only affect apps you install after the procedure. Previously installed apps will remain at the old location. If desired, you can “move” these existing apps to the new location by uninstalling them and then installing again from the Windows Store. Keep in mind though, you may lose any previously saved data and settings for apps that you move.
We discussed just one method to help free up internal disk space on your Windows tablet or laptop. If more space needs to be freed, perhaps get rid of unnecessary items: uninstall unused applications and bloat-ware, clean out temporary files, and delete old documents and files. Also, consider coping the Recovery Partition of the device to an external drive and delete it from the internal drive.

<title>Benchmarks Of The Open-Source Intel/AMD/NVIDIA Drivers, 11 Years On</title><article>In celebrating11 years since starting Phoroni to cover the Linux hardware scene, here's some fresh benchmarks of the open-source Intel / AMD / NVIDIA Linux graphics drivers. Various GPUs were tested atop Ubuntu when moving to Git with the Linux 4.1 kernel, Mesa 10.7-devel, and LLVM 3.7 SVNSimilar to the article earlier this weekcomparing many AMD/NVIDIA graphics cards with the latest proprietary driver, the Phoronix birthday article today is looking at the performance of various graphics cards on the very latest open-source driver code. In the days ahead I'll have another historical look at the open-source Linux graphics drivers over the past many years as another Phoronix birthday specialThis article isn't as large as the proprietary driver comparison article earlier this week for a few reasons: various issues encountered with the open-source NVIDIA (Nouveau) driver comparison;the GeForce GTX 900 series don't yet have working open-source hardware acceleratio; the Radeon R9 285 Tonga wasn't tested due to not testing the new AMDGPU driver support sincethat driver isn't landing until Linux 4. and requires branched versions of Mesa/DRM. The AMDGPU Linux testing will come in a separate articleOn the Intel side for testing was the Intel HD Graphics 4600 from the Core i7 4790K Haswell CPU used for testing. The tested AMD hardware was the Radeon HD 6570, HD 6870, HD 6950, HD 7950, and R9 290 based on available hardware.

<title>The Intel Broadwell Desktop Review: Core i7-5775C and Core i5-5765C Tested (Part 1)</title><article>On almost all PC technology forums, it is hard to escape users talking about what Intel&rsquo;s next processor lineup will be. Due to initial yield issues in Intel&rsquo;s 14nm node,Broadwel in both mobile and desktop ended up being delayed, somewhat substantially in the case of the desktop. So while motherboard manufacturers released their Z97 platform over 6 months ago, we have been waiting for Broadwell to arrive. That day is today, and we can lay the smackdown with some benchmark numbers tooBroadwell, in its top level explanation, is the 14nm die shrink of Haswell which was built on 22nm. Using Intel&rsquo;s 14nm process this results in a smaller silicon die and lower power consumption. Frequency will depend on the architecture and if the process is suited to frequency or power, but the CPU core underneath is still more-or-less Haswell, with some minor tweaks of courseAs part of Intel&rsquo;s tick-tock strategy, this would be considered a tickIf history tells us anything, ticks are usually accompanied by small IPC increases, resulting in 5-10% better performance depending on the benchmark, but ultimately ticks still follow the same capabilities of the processor before them. Intel usually uses its ticks to introduce a new chipset with a large number of capabilities, which we saw with Z97 and its use of M.2/SATA Express on the chipset. If the classical idea of a three year cycle between upgrades is true, then back in the summer of 2012, we were playing around with Ivy Bridge, the tick to Sandy BridgeBack in mid 2014,Intel launched Core , the first 14nm processor in the mass market and the first Broadwell based product. Core M is the official marketing designation for what was historically the Y series processor (Broadwell-Y), but Core M played a different role to other Y series processors. Core M brought the Core architecture down to a 4.5W thermal design, enabling small and thin fanless 2-in-1 laptop/tablet designs. When the first products started appearing around Christmas and CES, we tested a few and even got down and dirty with the questions that OEMs had to answer with their own chassis desAt CES (January 2015),Intel launched Broadwell-. These devices are aimed more at traditional laptops, mini-PCs and all-in-ones, with the lower-wattage SKUs targeting devices in the 15W range. At the same time higher power 28W SKUs were also announced, with the graphics gamut migrating through the basic Gen 8 package up to Crystal Well based Iris Pro, using onboard EDRAM as an additional cache to improve graphics performAfter Y and U in Intel&rsquo;s naming scheme typically comes H, representing higher power (47W-65W) mobile processors or ones suitable for all-in-one type desktop replacement devices which are, for the most part, stationary. H processors are favorites in business due to their high performance, but typically these devices also require large batteries and can come with large (15-17&rdquo;) screens. They are all soldered down parts as well. Technically some of the H processors are part of the launch todayAfter Y, U and H is somewhat of a miasma. The processor lineup, depending on who you speak to, might be DT, S, T, or K. Some of these are also used in the processor names themselves, but we will use Broadwell-DT for consistency. Normally an Intel desktop processor lineup spans a gamut of SKUs, from Celerons, Pentiums, i3, i5 and up to i7. Some ranges consist of 50 or so SKUs, whereby one segment (i5/i7, for example) are launched first and the rest are launched lBroadwell-H Die MThat brings us to today. All-told, Intel is launching ten different SKUs, five 47W laptop and five 65W &#39;desktop&#39;,&nbsp;using a mix of socketed (LGA) and soldered (BGA) parts. All five desktop&nbsp;SKUs are still technically Broadwell-H, and all five are 65W quad-core models featuring Intel&#39;s Iris Pro integrated graphics and the product&#39;s associated Crystal Well L4 cache. Meanwhile in an interesting turn of events, the two socketed models will be breaking the mold by becoming the first H-family processors to be socketed. These will be the parts we&#39;re looking at tIf we move back to those large processor stacks, Intel tends to produce a range of products from 15W TDP (extreme low power Xeon) through 35W, 55W and up to 84-88W for consumer then 160W for Xeon. Sticking with the consumer line for the moment, the high end overclocking models have recently sat in that 84-88W bracket, donning the i5-K or i7-K moniker and being some of the most talked about processors on forums and for custom builds. Broadwell changes this, and a lot of users might not expect it toBecause the top Broadwell-DT SKUs are based on Intel&#39;s Broadwell-H design, both of the these SKUs ship with a TDP of 65W. As a result, frequencies on the cores are lower, and it means that these processors are best suited for comparison to 65W Haswell processors, such as the i7-4790S or i5-4590S, rather than the i7-4770K or i7-4790K. Thus users looking to upgrade their i5-K or i7-K might be wondering where their 84W processor isBut both Broadwell-DT processors are overclockable, which adds an element of intrigue. I&rsquo;ll speak specifically about the Crystal Well implementation in a second, but whether having that extra eDRAM on board effect overclocking is going to be a poignant question moving forward. If a 4.6 GHz Haswell user can also achieve 4.6 GHz on Broadwell, then the benefit of any IPC increase along with the eDRAM might be a driver for purchase. Unfortunately althugh both of the socketed chips are unlocked, due to both time constraints and severe pre-release firmware issues, we&#39;re going to have to save overclocking on Broadwell-DT for Part 2 of our coverageIntel announced several months ago thatBroadwell would be getting the first socketed processor with a Crystal Well implementation that would also be overclockabl. For a number of us in the industry, this piqued our interest substantially. Crystal Well, Intel&rsquo;s name for CPUs that carry extra eDRAM, offers the potential to alleviate DRAM pressure by acting as an L4 cache, but also gives more memory bandwidth for integrated graphics. Given that integrated graphics are typically memory starved to begin with, Crystal Well when announced was an interesting prospect. Unfortunately, for Haswell based models, Intel limited the project to soldered processors only, which meant there was no possible direct desktop comparison. This changes with BroadwelAside from this, in terms of integrated graphics only usage, Broadwell-DT has a full GT3e configuration of execution units that a Broadwell processor has been announced to have. On Core-M we see 24&nbsp;EUs, Atom x7 with 16, Pentium/Celeron Broadwell-U has 12, while there are various models with 23 or 24 EUs in the Broadwell-U i3/i5 and i7 lines and a few Broadwell-U models with the full 48 EUs with Iris Pro 6100. There will be some Broadwell-H models with 48, which is the number that Broadwell-DT models with the designation &lsquo;C&rsquo; or &lsquo;R&rsquo; will haveThe current king of the socketed integrated graphics world isAMD&rsquo;s A10-7870K which we recently reviewed.

           "ISIS [also known as Islamic State] came onto the scene very quickly,  but they already have arguably the best cyber offensive capability of  any extremist movement out there, and it's still early days," Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure said"We still haven't seen real physical damage being done by any extremist  group, and it's probably going to take a while until we see it. But  these guys are the first ones that actually have some existing hackers  who have joined them and moved in from the West," Hypponen told the  AusCERT Information Security Conference on Australia's Gold Coast in his  keynote address on Friday morning"It's not yet really a big problem, but obviously this isn't getting better, this is getting worse," he saidOne such hacker is Abu Hussain Al Britani, a British citizen that  F-Secure had been tracking as a traditional hacker three years ago.

And he's  actually involved with the attacks that we saw against the US Central  Command in which the home addresses of US generals were posted online,"  Hypponen said"Yes, this is still far away from doing actual physical attacks.  Movements and groups like ISIS are the only kind of attacker which would  be willing to do attacks which don't have exact targets, and which  create undefined outcomes," he said"For example, trying to gain access to factory automation gear anywhere  in the West, and do random modifications to them. It might be an attack  which would actually make sense to them, but to no-one else. That's why I  worry about extremist movements in the cyber field."

           "ISIS [also known as Islamic State] came onto the scene very quickly,  but they already have arguably the best cyber offensive capability of  any extremist movement out there, and it's still early days," Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure said"We still haven't seen real physical damage being done by any extremist  group, and it's probably going to take a while until we see it. But  these guys are the first ones that actually have some existing hackers  who have joined them and moved in from the West," Hypponen told the  AusCERT Information Security Conference on Australia's Gold Coast in his  keynote address on Friday morning"It's not yet really a big problem, but obviously this isn't getting better, this is getting worse," he saidOne such hacker is Abu Hussain Al Britani, a British citizen that  F-Secure had been tracking as a traditional hacker three years ago. They  lost track of him two years ago, but found him again last summer in  SyriaAl Britani has been kicked off Twitter around 20 times, but appears to be tweeting again thiThe alleged Twitter accou

                                    "He was offline for maybe half a year, but he came back online two days  ago, together with his wife. They are both British citizens. And he's  actually involved with the attacks that we saw against the US Central  Command in which the home addresses of US generals were posted online,"  Hypponen said"Yes, this is still far away from doing actual physical attacks.  Movements and groups like ISIS are the only kind of attacker which would  be willing to do attacks which don't have exact targets, and which  create undefined outcomes," he said"For example, trying to gain access to factory automation gear anywhere  in the West, and do random modifications to them. It might be an attack  which would actually make sense to them, but to no-one else. That's why I  worry about extremist movements in the cyber field."

<title>Five new things we know about Skylake</title><article>With the upcoming release of Intel’s Skylake chips, there’s a lot to look forward to, including faster computers, fewer ports and wireless charging. At Computex in Taipei this week Intel shed more light on the new chip technology, a much hyped successor to Intel’s family of Broadwell family of chips. Here are five things we learned1) Skylake chips won’t be released when Windows 10 becomes commercially available on July 29, so PCs with a combination of the new OS and chip technology won’t be immediately available, said Kirk Skaugen, senior vice president and general manager of the PC Client Group at Intel, during an interview at Computex. Intel has built Skylake to work hand-in-glove with Windows 10, which among other new features offers biometric authentication that will allow a user’s fingerprint or face to replace a typed password. Skaugen declined to provide a specific release date, but Skylake could be the centerpiece announcement at the Intel Developer Forum in mid-August. PCs could follow soon after2) Mobile and desktop chips will be released at about the same time: Intel will launch a whole line of Skylake chips for tablets, laptops and desktops without a long wait between releases, Skaugen said. Intel usually releases chips in phases, based on form factors. For example, Core M tablet chips were the first Broadwell processors, with laptop chips following four to five months later. Core M may likewise be thefirst Skylake chi, though this time, laptop and desktop processors would come swiftly afterward3) Manufacturers have Skylake PCs details set: Asus at Computex announced Zen AiO all-in-one desktops that have support for DDR4 memory and USB 3.1. The company also showedmini-desktop capable of 4K video. Intel showed a 7.8-inch millimeter thicktable with a USB Type-C port on stage during a keynote at Computex. Dell has said it will ship Skylake chips in the second half of the year4) A wide variety of leading brands are on board with Wire-free computing: Intel wants to eliminate wire and cable clutter from PCs by offering wireless charging and data transfer circuitry in Skylake chipsets and motherboards. Users will be able to recharge laptops by placing them on tables or surfaces that support wireless charging based on magnetic resonance technology. Intel is getting restaurants, airports, cafes, appliance makers and car companies to install wireless charging surfaces. Hilton hotels, Emirates airlines, San Francisco Airport, Starbucks, Haier and Jaguar Land Rover are among those who have signed up. Another Intel plan to replace ports in laptops with wireless data transfer technology is a bit further out. Laptops will be able to wirelessly connect to portable hard drives, monitors and other external peripherals through a technology called WiGig, which can transfer data at 7Gbps (bits per second). But peripherals will also need WiGig circuitry, and it may be a while until that happens5) Thunderbolt 3 will start with Skylake: Intel is forecasting that about 30 laptops, tablets and desktops will ship by the end of the year with Thunderbolt 3, a new data transfer technology running on USB Type-C cables. At 40Gbps (bits per second), Thunderbolt is two times faster than its predecessor, and four times faster than USB 3.1 technology. It will also be possible to connect USB devices into the Thunderbolt ports. Do you need the blazing speed of Thunderbolt?

           Approximately 7,000 customers across New South Wales were reportedly affected by a technical error which saw them receiving calls not intended for them. "On Tuesday, technical staff identified an error in a database that is used to direct NBN voice calls. As a result, some Telstra NBN Voice customers in NSW were unable to receive incoming calls as the database incorrectly directed these calls to another number," a spokesperson for the telco said on FridayE-CommercGovernmenInnovatioNBTelco "Telstra apologises for the inconvenience this has caused to our customers." The incident was first reported byABC New  Since the incident on Tuesday, 130 customers were still experiencing problems with their Telstra NBN voice services and only had their correct phone numbers restored in the past 24 hours.   "Most of these services were restored on the same day but the remaining few were restored yesterday," the spokesperson said.   As more and more consumers make the switch to the NBN, Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN) is calling on Telstra to ensure that its older network is maintained so that consumers using that network get the same prompt service as those using Telstra NBN. Whilst ACCAN congratulated Telstra on its prompt action on Tuesday, they said in a statement today that they are concerned further issues have been reported.  Telstra have confirmed that customers will not be charged for voice calls made by these numbers for the duration of the incidentThe issue is likely to get more complicated as NBN begins its ramp up of the fibre-to-the-node deployment of the NBN which will utilise the existing copper network for services at the same time as ADSL services are connected.

<title>Silk Road mastermind appeals his case</title><article>
Facing life in prison, Ross Ulbricht is appealing his seven convictions for operating Silk Road, the illegal drugs online marketplace.
Ulbricht’s lawyer, Joshua Dratel, has not decided yet what issues the appeal will be based on, according to Dratel’s office.
Last week, Judge Katherine Forrest, who oversaw the jury case at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,gav Ulbricht two concurrent life sentences for aiding and abetting drug distribution, and for running a criminal enterprise.

Facing life in prison, Ross Ulbricht is appealing his seven convictions for operating Silk Road, the illegal drugs online marketplace.
Ulbricht’s lawyer, Joshua Dratel, has not decided yet what issues the appeal will be based on, according to Dratel’s office.
Last week, Judge Katherine Forrest, who oversaw the jury case at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,gav Ulbricht two concurrent life sentences for aiding and abetting drug distribution, and for running a criminal enterprise. He also got additional prison time for computer hacking (5 years), identification forgery (15 years) and money laundering (20 years), all to run concurrently.

<title>Dell Launches Premium Support Option For Consumers</title><article>Today Dell is unveiling a new offering in the world of after purchase support which they have dubbed Premium Support. It promises to significantly reduce the amount of time spent on the phone when there is an issue, and the support can encompass anything from hardware to software. To speed up the process, Dell leverages SupportAssist which will come pre-installed on the deviceThis kind of support level is something that the enterprise has seen for some time, and as recently as February Dell added it to their business level devices. Unlike traditional support, where it is a reactive model based upon the customer having an issue and reporting it, Dell&rsquo;s SupportAssist software monitors the system and, assuming you have an active subscription to the service, sends Dell notifications of issues with the device so that they can reach out to the customer through whatever means the customer prefers, so Dell can call or email letting them know that there is an issueOne of the key benefits of this approach is that if you do have an issue, the correct person can be the first point of contact rather than having to be bounced around while on hold. Dell commissioned Principled Technologies to simulate a support case using Dell&rsquo;s Premium Support with SupportAssist against the top-tier support of Apple, HP, and Lenovo, and the call time for Dell support for a broken hard drive was 4m 05s. Apple and Lenovo were about tied at 25m 44s for Apple and 25m 49s for Lenovo, with HP at 40m 40s. That was just the call time though. Apple then made an appointment for the customer to visit the Genius Bar for further troubleshooting, and HP wanted the laptop shipped to them for service or a refund. Dell and Lenovo both shipped out a new drive and an on-site technician for serPremium Support can also be used for other non-Dell issues, such as if you are having trouble with Excel Pivot Tables, or you are trying to upgrade a third party program. Dell wants it to be a one-stop shop for all computer support for Dell customers. They even said it could be used to help with migrating a computer over to Windows 10SupportAssist is free to all customers to help them with diagnosing their computers, and those that want to move up to the Premium Support model can do that starting at $39 per year. It is currently available in the USA and Canada on Dell Inspiron, Alienware, Venue, and Chromebook productsDell has obviously been successful with this practice in the business divisions, and it is the kind of software that is found on lots of enterprise products already like backup systems and storage area networks, so it is not a new practice altogether, but it is the first time it is being brought down to the consumer at a price they can afford. To hit this price point though, Dell is using overseas support rather than the NA support offered to its business customersI&rsquo;m not sure that this would ever be the right product for me, but on a larger scale, there are likely a lot of people that would like this kind of service. The low price helps a lot too. Of course there are a lot of concerns about how much info can they collect about your computer, and possibly even more troublesome is the scam where &ldquo;Microsoft Support&rdquo; calls you out of the blue to say your computer is broken, but now you actually have a service where someone may call you out of the blue saying they are from Dell and your computer has an issue. However this model has proven to be successful in the enterprise and business sectors and Dell&rsquo;s SupportAssist is based off of Compellent&rsquo;s technology from when Dell acquired them in 2010If you are someone who might be interested in checking out more about Dell&rsquo;s new support offering, check outwww.dell.com/premiumsuppToday Dell is unveiling a new offering in the world of after purchase support which they have dubbed Premium Support.

<title>Don&#039;t expect major changes to NSA surveillance from Congress</title><article>After the U.S. Congress approved what critics have called modest limits on the National Security Agency’s collection of domestic telephone records, many lawmakers may be reluctant to further change the government’s surveillance programsThe Senate this weekpassed the USA Freedom Ac, which aims to end the NSA’s mass collection of domestic phone records, and President Barack Obama signed the bill hours laterAfter that action, expect Republican leaders in both the Senate and the House of Representatives to resist further calls for surveillance reform. That resistance is at odds with many rank-and-file lawmakers, including many House Republicans, who want to further limit NSA programs brought to light by former agency contractor Edward SnowdenCivil liberties groups and privacy advocates also promise to push for more changes. It may be difficult to get “broad, sweeping reform” through Congress, but many lawmakers seem ready to push for more changes, said Adam Eisgrau, managing director of the office of government relations for the American Library Association. The ALA has charged the NSA surveillance programs violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures“Congress is not allowed to be tired of surveillance reform unless it’s prepared to say it’s tired of the Fourth Amendment,” Eisgrau said. “The American public will not accept that.Other activists are less optimistic about more congressional action. “It will a long slog getting more restraints,” J. Kirk Wiebe, a formerNSA analyst and whistleblowe said by email. ”The length of that journey will depend on public outcry—that is the one thing that is hard to gauge.With the USA Freedom Act, “elected officials have opted to reach for low-hanging fruit,” said Bill Blunden, a cybersecurity researcher and surveillance critic. “The theater we’ve just witnessed allows decision makers to boast to their constituents about reforming mass surveillance while spies understand that what’s actually transpired is hardly major change.The “actual physical mechanisms” of surveillance programs remain largely intact. Blunden added by email. “Politicians may dither around the periphery but they are unlikely to institute fundamental changes.What’s in the USA Freedom ActSome critics have blasted theUSA Freedom Ac as fake reform, while supporters have called it the biggest overhaul of U.S. surveillance program in decades. Many civil liberties and privacy groups have come down in the middle of those two views, calling it modest reform of the counterterrorism Patriot AcThe law aim to end the NSA’s decade-plus practice of collecting U.S. telephone records in bulk, while allowing the agency to search those records in a more targeted mannerThe law also moves the phone records database from the NSA to telecom carriers, and requires the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to consult with tech and privacy experts when ruling on major new data collection requests from the NSA. It also requires all significant FISC orders from the last 12 years to be released to the publicThe new law limits bulk collection of U.S. telephone and business records by requiring the FBI, the agency that applies for data collection, to use a “specific selection term” when asking the surveillance court to authorize records searches. The law prohibits the FBI and NSA from using a “broad geographic region,” including a city, county, state or zip code, as a search term, but it doesn’t otherwise define “specific search term.That’s a problem, according to critics. The surveillance court could allow, for example, “AT&amp;T” as a specific search term and give the NSA the authority to collect all of the carrier’s customer records. Such a ruling from FISC would seem to run counter to congressional intent, but this is the same court that defined all U.S. phone records as “relevant” to a counterterrorism investigation under the old version of the Patriot Act’s Section 215The USA Freedom Act also does nothing to limit the NSA’s surveillance of overseas Internet traffic, including the content of emails and IP voice calls. Significantly limiting that NSA program, called Prism in 2013 Snowden leaks, will be a difficult task in Congress, with many lawmakers unconcerned about the privacy rights of people who don’t vote in U.S. electionsStill, thesection of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Ac that authorizes those NSA foreign surveillance programs sunsets in 2017, and that deadline will force Congress to look at FISA, although lawmakers may wait until the last minute, as they did with the expiring sections of the Patriot Act covered in the USA Freedom ActThe House Judiciary Committee will continue its oversight of U.S. surveillance programs, and the committee will address FISA before its provisions expire, an aide to the committee saidRepublican leaders opposed to more changeSupporters of new reforms will have to bypass congressional leadership, however. Senate Republican leaders attempted to derail even the USA Freedom Act and refused to allow amendments that would require further changes at the NSAIn the House, Republican leaders threatened to kill the USA Freedom Act if the Judiciary Committee amended the bill to address other surveillance programs. Still, many House members, both Republicans and Democrats, have pushed for new surveillance limits, with lawmakers adding an amendment to end so-called backdoor government searches of domestic communications to alarge appropriations bil this weekObama’s administration has threatened to veto the appropriations bill for several unrelated reasons, but several House members have pledged to push hard to prohibit the FBI and CIA fromsearching the conten of reportedly tens of thousands of U.S. communications swept up in an NSA surveillance program targeting overseas terrorism suspectsClosing that surveillance backdoor is a top priority for civil liberties groups, said Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington, D.C., legislative office. “We’ve had this statute that masquerades as affecting only people abroad, but the reality is that it sweeps up large numbers of U.S. persons,” she saidOther changes possiblAdvocates and lawmakers will also push for a handful of other surveillance reforms in the coming months. The changes most likely to pass make limited changes to surveillance programs, howeverWhile not tied to NSA surveillance, lawmakers will press for changes to the 29-year-old Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), a wiretap law that gives law enforcement agencies warrantless access to emails and other communications stored in the cloud for more than six months. AHouse version of ECPA refor counts more than half the body as co-sponsorsStill, tech companies and civil liberties groups have beenpushing since 201 to have those communications protected by warrants, but law enforcement agencies and some Republican lawmakers have successfully opposed the changesAnother bill that may gain traction in coming months is theJudicial Redress Ac, a bill that would allow citizens of some countries to file lawsuits under the U.S. Privacy Act if government agencies misuse their records“The Privacy Act offers limited protections, even to Americans, but passage of this bill would be an important first step to addressing especially European concerns that US privacy reforms won’t help them,” said Berin Szoka, president of free market think tank TechFreedomPublic pressure, along with potentially new leaks, will be the key to driving any more surveillance changes, advocates said“The public will for mass surveillance laws was made very clear recently, and that’s partly why we saw much of Congress flock to whatever could be called surveillance reform,” said Tiffiniy Cheng, a founder of digital rights group Fight for the Future. “No one is fooled by USA Freedom—it’s a weak piece of legislation that uses exceptions in legislative language to codify the NSA’s practice of surveilling most people.Congress has much work left to do, Cheng said by email. “After the recent showdown and public outcry, USA Freedom is at best, seen as a beginning of surveillance reform, not the end,” she saidGrant Gross covers technology and telecom policy in the U.S. government for the IDG News Service, and is based in Washington, D.More bGrant GUse commas to separate multiple email addresseYour message has been sentThere was an error emailing this pagHardcore Hardware: CyberPower Trinity Xtre

AHouse version of ECPA refor counts more than half the body as co-sponsorsStill, tech companies and civil liberties groups have beenpushing since 201 to have those communications protected by warrants, but law enforcement agencies and some Republican lawmakers have successfully opposed the changesAnother bill that may gain traction in coming months is theJudicial Redress Ac, a bill that would allow citizens of some countries to file lawsuits under the U.S. Privacy Act if government agencies misuse their records“The Privacy Act offers limited protections, even to Americans, but passage of this bill would be an important first step to addressing especially European concerns that US privacy reforms won’t help them,” said Berin Szoka, president of free market think tank TechFreedomPublic pressure, along with potentially new leaks, will be the key to driving any more surveillance changes, advocates said“The public will for mass surveillance laws was made very clear recently, and that’s partly why we saw much of Congress flock to whatever could be called surveillance reform,” said Tiffiniy Cheng, a founder of digital rights group Fight for the Future. “No one is fooled by USA Freedom—it’s a weak piece of legislation that uses exceptions in legislative language to codify the NSA’s practice of surveilling most people.Congress has much work left to do, Cheng said by email. “After the recent showdown and public outcry, USA Freedom is at best, seen as a beginning of surveillance reform, not the end,” she saidGrant Gross covers technology and telecom policy in the U.S. government for the IDG News Service, and is based in Washington, D.More bGrant GUse commas to separate multiple email addresseYour message has been sentThere was an error emailing this pagHardcore Hardware: CyberPower Trinity Xtre

<title>Hacker turns toy into tool that can open garage doors in seconds</title><article>
Owners of fixed-code garage door openers might want to consider upgrading them because a researcher has developed a technique that guesses the numbers in seconds.
To showcase the new attack, which he dubbed Open Sesame, security researcher Samy Kamkarreprogrammed a children’s to designed for short-distance texting called Radica Girl Tech IM-me because it has all the needed wireless components and because “it’s pink,” his favorite color.
With a fixed-code garage door opener, the remote control, or “clicker” always transmits the same 8 to 12-bit binary code. For a 12-bit code, there are 4,096 possible combinations—strings of 1s and 0s.
The fact that openers’ fixed-codes can be cracked through brute-force is a known issue, but doing so was believed to take longer. A typical clicker resends the same code 5 times, with a transmission time of 2 milliseconds per bit and an additional wait time of 2 milliseconds between each bit.
By Kamkar’s calculations, following this process to iterate through all possible combinations for 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12-bit codes would take 29 minutes.
However, it turns out that retransmitting the same code 5 times is unnecessary and so is the wait time between each bit. By removing those steps, the researcher found that the time needed to brute-force a fixed garage door opener code is reduced to about 3 minutes.
But that was still not fast enough for him. Kamkar then figured out that when the opener interprets a continuous string of bits it doesn’t test the first 12 bits as a possible code and then the next 12 bits and so on.
Instead, the opener tests the first n bits in the string—n can be 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12, depending on which code length is expected—and then drops only the first bit and tests the remaining sequence again. For example, if the expected length would be 3 bits and the opener would receive a 101011 sequence, it would first try 101, then 010, then 101 and so on.
This finding allowed Kamkar to develop a so-called De Bruijn sequence—a sequence that includes each combination of bits only once. This is based on a formula devised by Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn.
“OpenSesame implements this algorithm to produce every possible overlapping sequence of 8-12 bits in the least amount of time,” Kamkar said. “How little time? 8.214 seconds.”
And that’s the worst case scenario. Typically the correct code will be found faster than that.
New generation garage door openers that use rolling codes—also known as Intellicode, Security+ or hopping codes depending on vendor—are not affected by this attack. However, vulnerable products are still sold by some manufacturers and many discontinued ones are likely still in use, Kamkar said.
Kamkar releasedproof-of-concept cod for his attack on GitHub, but the code is intentionally incomplete to avoid abuse by criminals.
“It almost works, but just not quite, and is released to educate,” the researcher said. “If you are an expert in RF and microcontrollers, you could fix it, but then you wouldn’t need my help in the first place, would you.”Lucian Constantin writes about information security, privacy, and data protection for the IDG News ServicMore bLucian ConstaUse commas to separate multiple email addresseYour message has been sentThere was an error emailing this pagHardcore Hardware: CyberPower Trinity Xtre

Vodafone is not in discussions with Liberty Global concerning a combination of the two companies," Vodafone said in a statement. It added that there is no certainty that any deal will ultimately be reached.Rumours of a union between the two telcos gathered steam recently when Liberty Global's chairman John Malone toldBloomber that Vodafone would be a "great fit" with the company, particularly in Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. "We've looked at that from our side and there would be very substantial synergies if we could find a way to work together or combine the companies with respect to western Europe," hetold the publication last mont.Mobile giant Vodafone has networks in 26 countries and 444 million customers worldwide. While the majority of its customers use its mobile products, it also has 12 million broadband subscribers and more than nine million TV customers, according to its most recent financial results. Last year, the company acquiredSpanish cable company Ono for €7.2b, and is in the process of extending its fibre footprint by 3.9 million premises in EuropeThe company said it's putting an increased emphasis on the fixed side of its business, rolling out bundled packages - such as broadband, TV, and mobile - across all its major European markets. It has also seen growing interest from enterprises in taking converged servicesLiberty Global is best known for its cable services, available across 12 European countries, as well as Chile and Puerto Rico. The company has been acquisitive in recent years: itbought UK ISP Virgin Media for $23.3b in 2013, Dutch cableoperator Ziggo for €10bn last yea, and the Belgian mobile networkBase for €1.3bn earlier this yea. "Liberty Global's business strategy emphasizes... opportunistic M&amp;A activity", the company'swebsite sayVodafone didn't detail which assets the two businesses are considering swapping. According to th Financial Tim, analysts believe Liberty Global may look to exchange its German business for Vodafone's UK and Netherlands operations. Equally, Vodafone may wish to acquire Virgin Media and Liberty Global's Dutch businesses, in return for ceding its German unit and paying additional cash. Any such exchange would allow Vodafone and Liberty Global to bolster their triple and quad-play offerings in their respective marketRead mor

"We've looked at that from our side and there would be very substantial synergies if we could find a way to work together or combine the companies with respect to western Europe," hetold the publication last mont.Mobile giant Vodafone has networks in 26 countries and 444 million customers worldwide. While the majority of its customers use its mobile products, it also has 12 million broadband subscribers and more than nine million TV customers, according to its most recent financial results. Last year, the company acquiredSpanish cable company Ono for €7.2b, and is in the process of extending its fibre footprint by 3.9 million premises in EuropeThe company said it's putting an increased emphasis on the fixed side of its business, rolling out bundled packages - such as broadband, TV, and mobile - across all its major European markets. It has also seen growing interest from enterprises in taking converged servicesLiberty Global is best known for its cable services, available across 12 European countries, as well as Chile and Puerto Rico. The company has been acquisitive in recent years: itbought UK ISP Virgin Media for $23.3b in 2013, Dutch cableoperator Ziggo for €10bn last yea, and the Belgian mobile networkBase for €1.3bn earlier this yea. "Liberty Global's business strategy emphasizes... opportunistic M&amp;A activity", the company'swebsite sayVodafone didn't detail which assets the two businesses are considering swapping. According to th Financial Tim, analysts believe Liberty Global may look to exchange its German business for Vodafone's UK and Netherlands operations. Equally, Vodafone may wish to acquire Virgin Media and Liberty Global's Dutch businesses, in return for ceding its German unit and paying additional cash. Any such exchange would allow Vodafone and Liberty Global to bolster their triple and quad-play offerings in their respective marketRead mor

<title>This week in games: Our first look at Bard&#039;s Tale IV, Battleborn, Soma, and more</title><article>This week&#039;s must-know games news
Computex. Fallout 4. Steam Machines. Steamrefund. It's been a crazy week, and we haven't even talked about Spike Lee directing NBA 2k16's campaign mode. Yet.
That, plus our first look atBard's Tale I,Som, andBattlebornbelow—this is gaming news for the week of June 1, 2015.
The Kickstarter project for inXile'Bard's Tale  went live this week and it's already pretty much funded. But there's still 35 days for you to kick in some money, if you want! And you might want, after seeing this trailer:
Can't wait for the Steam Summer Sale? You can dip your toe in right now by heading toGOG.co and indulging in a DRM-free feast of game discounts. Amazon to, for that matter.
Sick of looking atFallout 's Boston through YouTube compression? Or just want some sweetFallout  wallpaper? Following this week's reveal, Bethesda released a handful of 1080p screenshots for you to peruse.
Look at all thatcolo.
I don't really know what this game is, but the press release says "In Symphony Worlds, the user's music creates unique, living, breathing worlds that are overrun by a mysterious demonic foe," which makes it sound like some sort ofAudiosur-style game. And I am always down for anotherAudiosur-style game.
Here's a quick teaser:
VG247 posted rumors this week that we'll seeDark Souls  at E3—and that originalDark Soul overseer Hidetaka Miyazaki would be returning to the series now that he's done with PS4-exclusiveBloodborn.
Here’s my own wildly speculative rumor: I'm going to guessDark Souls  definitely exists, regardless of whether we see it during E3 or not.
Now thatThe Witcher 3is out, Frictional's new gameSom is pretty much my most anticipated PC game. Meaning I'm not even going to watch this trailer. I'm just going to say "It's twelve minutes of gameplay and I'm sure it's probably pretty good."
Can a trailer be an "E3 Trailer" prior to E3? Gearbox sure thinks so, releasing this "E3 Trailer" for shooter/MOBA hybridBattlebor earlier this week:
I'm loving the character silhouettes. And…did I just see a sentient mushroom dude?

<title>Intel Announces Thunderbolt 3 - Thunderbolt Meets USB (At Last)</title><article>A lot has been happening in the world of external communication buses over the past year. In the last 12 months the USB consortium has announced both10Gbps &ldquo;Superspeed+&rdquo; USB 3. and the newUSB Type-C connecto, USB&rsquo;s new compact, reversible connector that is designed to drive the standard for the next decade or more. Meanwhile with the introduction ofUSB Alternate Mode functionalit &ndash; the ability for USB Type-C to carry other protocols along with (or instead of) USB Superspeed data &ndash; has made USB more flexible than ever, with the VESA announcing that DisplayPort will be supporting alternate mode to deliver DisplayPort video over USB Type-C ports and cablingAs a result, the introduction of USB Type-C has led to a definite and relatively rapid transition over to the new standard. With the USB consortium having designed a very capable and desirable physical layer for Type-C, and then alternate modes allowing anyone to use that physical layer, there have been a number of other technologies that have started aligning themselves with USB in order to take advantage of what is becoming an even more common platform for external bUSB Type-C Connector On Apple&#39;s MacBoThis brings us to today, with the announcement of Thunderbolt 3 from Intel. With the advancements occurring elsewhere in the world of external communication buses, Intel has not been sitting idly by and letting other standards surpass Thunderbolt. Rather they have been hard at work on the next generation of Thunderbolt, one that in the end seeks to combine the recent developments of the USB Type-C physical layer with all of the feature and performance advantages of Thunderbolt, culminating in Thunderbolt 3 and its incredibly fast 40GbpsAs a bit of background, the last time Intel updated the Thunderbolt specificationwas in 2013 for Thunderbolt , AKA Falcon Ridge. By aggregating together two of Thunderbolt 1&rsquo;s 10Gbps channels, Intel was able to increase the available bandwidth over a single channel from 10Gbps to 20Gbps, at the cost of reducing the total number of channels from two full duplex channels to one full duplex channel. Of particular note here is that with Thunderbolt 2 the Thunderbolt signaling layer didn&rsquo;t change &ndash; Thunderbolt 2 still operated at 10Gbps for each of its four underlying lanes &ndash; so in reality the Thunderbolt signaling layer has remained unchangedsince it was introduced 201Now at 4 years old, it&rsquo;s time for the Thunderbolt signaling layer to change in order to support more bandwidth per cable than what Thunderbolt 1 and 2 could drive. To accomplish this upgrade in signaling layers, Intel has needed to change the physical layer as well. Thunderbolt 1 and 2 used the Apple-developed mini-DisplayPort interface for their cables, but with the VESA signaling that it may eventually replace the DisplayPort physical layer with USB Type-C, the DisplayPort physical layer&rsquo;s days are likely numbered. Consequently mini-DisplayPort&rsquo;s days are numbered as well, as consumer devices and the development of new standards both shift over to Type-CThis has put Thunderbolt in an interesting situation that has Thunderbolt moving forwards and backwards at the same time. As originally planned, Intel wanted to have Thunderbolt running through USB ports, only for the USB consortium to strike down that idea, resulting in the shift over to mini-DisplayPort. Now however with the waning of DisplayPort and the introduction of USB Type-C and its alternate modes, Thunderbolt is back to where Intel wanted to start all along, as a standard built on top of the common USB The end result of this process of upgrading of virtually every aspect of Thunderbolt is the latest generation of the technology, Thunderbolt 3, which seeks to combine the strengths and capabilities of the Thunderbolt platform with the strengths and capabilities of USB Type-C. This means bringing together Thunderbolt&rsquo;s very high data speeds and the flexibility of its underlying PCI-Express protocol with the simple, robust design of the Type-C connector, all enabled via the USB alternate mode specification. Throw in Type-C&rsquo;s associated power delivery standards, and you have what Intel believes to be the most powerful and capable external communications bus on the marketAlong with the change to using the USB Type-C port, the big news here is that Thunderbolt 3 is doubling the amount of bandwidth available to Thunderbolt devices. With Thunderbolt 2 topping out at a single full duplex 20Gbps channel, Thunderbolt 3 is increasing that to 40Gbps. Compared to DisplayPort 1.3 and USB 3.1, this is 1.5 to 4 times the available bandwidth, with DisplayPort 1.3 topping out at 25.9Gbps (after overhead), and USB 3.1 topping out at 10Gbps per channel (with Type-C carrying 2 such channels)From a signaling standpoint, Thunderbolt 3 is being implemented as a USB alternate mode, taking over the 4 lanes of high-speed data that Type-C offers. This is the same number of lanes as Thunderbolt 1 and 2 used, so the bandwidth increase comes as a result of doubling the amount of data carried per lane from 10Gbps (half duplex) to 20Gbps. Which when aggregated at either end is what gives us 20Gbps full duTo handle the new Type-C interface and the increased data rates, Intel is rolling out a new type of active cable for the new Thunderbolt standard. Like previous generation cables, the new cable includes significant active electronics at both ends of the cable, allowing Intel to achieve greater bandwidth than what passive cabling would allow, at the cost of increased cable prices. The new cable retains the distinctive Thunderbolt logo and is a bit larger than a passive at both ends to accommodate the electronics, but other than the change to the Type-C port is similar in concept to Thunderbolt 1 and 2&rsquo;s active caMeanwhile because it&rsquo;s built on Type-C, Thunderbolt 3.0 will also introduce support for passive cabling using the now-standard Type-C cable. When using a Type-C cable, Thunderbolt drops down to 20Gbps full duplex &ndash; the amount of bandwidth available in a normal Type-C cable today &ndash; sacrificing some bandwidth for cost. With Type-C cables expected to eventually cost only a few dollars compared to thirty dollars or more for traditional Thunderbolt cables, this makes Thunderbolt far more palatable as far as cable costs go, not to mention allowing cables to be more robust and more easily replacedDriving these new cables in turn will be Intel&rsquo;s new Alpine Ridge controller for Thunderbolt 3. The latest generation of the Ridge family, this controller steps up in capabilities to match Thunderbolt 3&rsquo;s 40Gbps speeds. Alpine Ridge also integrates its own USB 3.1 (Superspeed+) host controller, which in turn serves dual purposes. When serving as a host controller for a USB Type-C port, this allows Alpine Ridge to directly drive USB 3.1 device if they&rsquo;re plugged into an Alpine Ridge-backed Type-C port (similar to how DisplayPort works today with Thunderbolt ports). And when serving as a device controller (e.g. in a Thunderbolt monitor), this allows devices to utilize and/or offer USB 3.1 ports on theirThe addition of USB host controller functionality further increases the number of protocols that Thunderbolt 3 carries in one way or another. Along with PCI-Express and DisplayPort, the use of Alpine Ridge ensures that USB 3.1 is also available, as it&rsquo;s now a built-in function of the controller. The only notable difference here is that while DisplayPort video and PCI-Express data encapsulated in the Thunderbolt data stream, USB 3.1 is being implemented on top of the PCI-Express connection that Thunderbolt already carries rather than being encapsulated in the Thunderbolt data streamSpeaking of encapsulation, Thunderbolt 3 also includes an update to the DisplayPort side of matters, though likely not what everyone has been expecting. With the increase in bandwidth, Thunderbolt 3 is able to carry twice as much video data as before. However Intel is not implementing the latest version of DisplayPort &ndash; DisplayPort 1.3 &ndash; in to the Thunderbolt 3 standard. Instead they are doubling up on DisplayPort 1.2, expanding the number of equivalent DisplayPort lanes carried from 4 to 8, essentially allowing one Thunderbolt 3 cable to carry 2 full DisplayPort 1.2 connections. The end result is that Thunderbolt 3 will not be able to drive the kind of next-generation displays DisplayPort 1.3 is geared towards &ndash; things like 8K displays and 5K single-tile displays &ndash; but it will be able to drive anything 1 or 2 DisplayPort 1.2 connections can drive today, including multiple 4K@60Hz monitors or 5K multi-tile dispMeanwhile gamers will be happy to hear that Intel is finally moving forward on external graphics via Thunderbolt, and aftermore than a few false start, external GPUs now have the company&rsquo;s blessing and support. While Thunderbolt has in theory always been able of supporting external graphics (it&rsquo;s just a PCIe bus), the biggest hold-up has always been handling what to do about GPU hot-plugging and the so-called &ldquo;surprise removal&rdquo; scenario. Intel tells us that they have since solved that problem, and are now able to move forward with external graphics. The company is initially partnering with AMD on this endeavor &ndash; though nothing excludes NVIDIA in the long-run &ndash; with concepts being floated for both a full power external Thunderbolt card chassis, and a smaller &ldquo;graphics dock&rdquo; which contains a smaller, cooler (but still more powerful than an iGPU) mobile discreteAnother concept Intel has been floating around that will finally be getting some traction with Thunderbolt 3 is Thunderbolt networking. By emulating a 10GigE Ethernet connection, 2 computers can be networked via Thunderbolt cable, and with 10GigE still virtually unseen outside of servers and high-end workstations, this is a somewhat more practical solution for faster-than GigE networking. Thunderbolt networking has been around since 2013 in OS X, and in 2014 Intel demonstrated the technology working on PCs, however since it was a feature added to Thunderbolt 2 after its launch, the number of PCs with the necessary drivers for Thunderbolt networking has been quite low. With Thunderbolt 3 this is now a standard feature at launch, so system support for it should be greMoving on, by building Thunderbolt 3 on top of USB Type-C, Intel is also inheriting Type-C power delivery capabilities, which they will be making ample use of. With Type-C&rsquo;s Power Deliver 2.0 specification allowing for chargers that can supply up to 100W of power, it will be possible (though optional) to use Thunderbolt 3 to deliver that same power, allowing for uses such as having a Thunderbolt dock or display charge a laptop over the single Thunderbolt cable (the one thing Apple&rsquo;s Thunderbolt display can&rsquo;t do today with Thunderbolt 2). That said, the USB power delivery standard is distinct from Thunderbolt&rsquo;s bus power standard, so this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that all Thunderbolt hosts can provide 100W of power, or even any USB charging power for that matter. For standard bus-powered Thunderbolt devices, the Thunderbolt connection will now carry 15W of power, up from 10W for ThunderboFinally, with the change in cabling, Intel is also clarifying how Thunderbolt backwards compatibility will work. Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt adapters will be developed, which in turn will allow Thunderbolt 1/2 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts and devices to interoperate, so that older devices can work on newer hosts, and newer devices can work on older hosts. Though we&rsquo;re not clear at this time whether the adapter is providing a simple bridge between the cable types (with the necessary regeneration), or if there&rsquo;s going to be a complete Alpine Ridge controller in the adaWrapping things up, Intel tells us that they expect to see Thunderbolt 3 products begin shipping by the end of the year, with a larger volume of products in 2016. Given this timing we&rsquo;re almost certain to see Thunderbolt shipping alongside Skylake products, though Intel is making it clear that at a technical level Skylake and Thunderbolt 3 are not interconnected, and that it would be possible to pair Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt 3 controllers with other devices, be it Broadwell, Haswell-E, or other productsAs for whether Intel will see more success with Thunderbolt 3 than the previous versions of Thunderbolt, this remains to be seen. The switch to a Type-C port definitely makes it a bit easier for OEMs to stomach &ndash; DisplayPort on laptops has been fairly rare outside of Apple &ndash; so now OEMs can integrate Thunderbolt without having to install a port they don&rsquo;t see much value in. On the other hand this is still an external controller of additional cost, which incurs power, space, and cooling considerations, all of which would add to the cost of a desktop/laptop as opposed to pure USB 3.1. As was the case with Thunderbolt 1 and 2, Intel&rsquo;s greatest argument in favor of the technology is docking, as the use of PCI-Express and now the addition of USB Power Delivery gives Thunderbolt a degree of flexibility and performance that USB Type-C alone doesn&rsquA lot has been happening in the world of external communication buses over the past year. In the last 12 months the USB consortium has announced both10Gbps &ldquo;Superspeed+&rdquo; USB 3. and the newUSB Type-C connecto, USB&rsquo;s new compact, reversible connector that is designed to drive the standard for the next decade or more. Meanwhile with the introduction ofUSB Alternate Mode functionalit &ndash; the ability for USB Type-C to carry other protocols along with (or instead of) USB Superspeed data &ndash; has made USB more flexible than ever, with the VESA announcing that DisplayPort will be supporting alternate mode to deliver DisplayPort video over USB Type-C ports and cablingAs a result, the introduction of USB Type-C has led to a definite and relatively rapid transition over to the new standard. With the USB consortium having designed a very capable and desirable physical layer for Type-C, and then alternate modes allowing anyone to use that physical layer, there have been a number of other technologies that have started aligning themselves with USB in order to take advantage of what is becoming an even more common platform for external bUSB Type-C Connector On Apple&#39;s MacBoThis brings us to today, with the announcement of Thunderbolt 3 from Intel. With the advancements occurring elsewhere in the world of external communication buses, Intel has not been sitting idly by and letting other standards surpass Thunderbolt. Rather they have been hard at work on the next generation of Thunderbolt, one that in the end seeks to combine the recent developments of the USB Type-C physical layer with all of the feature and performance advantages of Thunderbolt, culminating in Thunderbolt 3 and its incredibly fast 40GbpsAs a bit of background, the last time Intel updated the Thunderbolt specificationwas in 2013 for Thunderbolt , AKA Falcon Ridge. By aggregating together two of Thunderbolt 1&rsquo;s 10Gbps channels, Intel was able to increase the available bandwidth over a single channel from 10Gbps to 20Gbps, at the cost of reducing the total number of channels from two full duplex channels to one full duplex channel. Of particular note here is that with Thunderbolt 2 the Thunderbolt signaling layer didn&rsquo;t change &ndash; Thunderbolt 2 still operated at 10Gbps for each of its four underlying lanes &ndash; so in reality the Thunderbolt signaling layer has remained unchangedsince it was introduced 201Now at 4 years old, it&rsquo;s time for the Thunderbolt signaling layer to change in order to support more bandwidth per cable than what Thunderbolt 1 and 2 could drive. To accomplish this upgrade in signaling layers, Intel has needed to change the physical layer as well. Thunderbolt 1 and 2 used the Apple-developed mini-DisplayPort interface for their cables, but with the VESA signaling that it may eventually replace the DisplayPort physical layer with USB Type-C, the DisplayPort physical layer&rsquo;s days are likely numbered. Consequently mini-DisplayPort&rsquo;s days are numbered as well, as consumer devices and the development of new standards both shift over to Type-CThis has put Thunderbolt in an interesting situation that has Thunderbolt moving forwards and backwards at the same time. As originally planned, Intel wanted to have Thunderbolt running through USB ports, only for the USB consortium to strike down that idea, resulting in the shift over to mini-DisplayPort. Now however with the waning of DisplayPort and the introduction of USB Type-C and its alternate modes, Thunderbolt is back to where Intel wanted to start all along, as a standard built on top of the common USB The end result of this process of upgrading of virtually every aspect of Thunderbolt is the latest generation of the technology, Thunderbolt 3, which seeks to combine the strengths and capabilities of the Thunderbolt platform with the strengths and capabilities of USB Type-C. This means bringing together Thunderbolt&rsquo;s very high data speeds and the flexibility of its underlying PCI-Express protocol with the simple, robust design of the Type-C connector, all enabled via the USB alternate mode specification. Throw in Type-C&rsquo;s associated power delivery standards, and you have what Intel believes to be the most powerful and capable external communications bus on the marketAlong with the change to using the USB Type-C port, the big news here is that Thunderbolt 3 is doubling the amount of bandwidth available to Thunderbolt devices. With Thunderbolt 2 topping out at a single full duplex 20Gbps channel, Thunderbolt 3 is increasing that to 40Gbps. Compared to DisplayPort 1.3 and USB 3.1, this is 1.5 to 4 times the available bandwidth, with DisplayPort 1.3 topping out at 25.9Gbps (after overhead), and USB 3.1 topping out at 10Gbps per channel (with Type-C carrying 2 such channels)From a signaling standpoint, Thunderbolt 3 is being implemented as a USB alternate mode, taking over the 4 lanes of high-speed data that Type-C offers. This is the same number of lanes as Thunderbolt 1 and 2 used, so the bandwidth increase comes as a result of doubling the amount of data carried per lane from 10Gbps (half duplex) to 20Gbps. Which when aggregated at either end is what gives us 20Gbps full duTo handle the new Type-C interface and the increased data rates, Intel is rolling out a new type of active cable for the new Thunderbolt standard. Like previous generation cables, the new cable includes significant active electronics at both ends of the cable, allowing Intel to achieve greater bandwidth than what passive cabling would allow, at the cost of increased cable prices. The new cable retains the distinctive Thunderbolt logo and is a bit larger than a passive at both ends to accommodate the electronics, but other than the change to the Type-C port is similar in concept to Thunderbolt 1 and 2&rsquo;s active caMeanwhile because it&rsquo;s built on Type-C, Thunderbolt 3.0 will also introduce support for passive cabling using the now-standard Type-C cable. When using a Type-C cable, Thunderbolt drops down to 20Gbps full duplex &ndash; the amount of bandwidth available in a normal Type-C cable today &ndash; sacrificing some bandwidth for cost. With Type-C cables expected to eventually cost only a few dollars compared to thirty dollars or more for traditional Thunderbolt cables, this makes Thunderbolt far more palatable as far as cable costs go, not to mention allowing cables to be more robust and more easily replacedDriving these new cables in turn will be Intel&rsquo;s new Alpine Ridge controller for Thunderbolt 3. The latest generation of the Ridge family, this controller steps up in capabilities to match Thunderbolt 3&rsquo;s 40Gbps speeds. Alpine Ridge also integrates its own USB 3.1 (Superspeed+) host controller, which in turn serves dual purposes. When serving as a host controller for a USB Type-C port, this allows Alpine Ridge to directly drive USB 3.1 device if they&rsquo;re plugged into an Alpine Ridge-backed Type-C port (similar to how DisplayPort works today with Thunderbolt ports). And when serving as a device controller (e.g. in a Thunderbolt monitor), this allows devices to utilize and/or offer USB 3.1 ports on theirThe addition of USB host controller functionality further increases the number of protocols that Thunderbolt 3 carries in one way or another. Along with PCI-Express and DisplayPort, the use of Alpine Ridge ensures that USB 3.1 is also available, as it&rsquo;s now a built-in function of the controller. The only notable difference here is that while DisplayPort video and PCI-Express data encapsulated in the Thunderbolt data stream, USB 3.1 is being implemented on top of the PCI-Express connection that Thunderbolt already carries rather than being encapsulated in the Thunderbolt data streamSpeaking of encapsulation, Thunderbolt 3 also includes an update to the DisplayPort side of matters, though likely not what everyone has been expecting. With the increase in bandwidth, Thunderbolt 3 is able to carry twice as much video data as before. However Intel is not implementing the latest version of DisplayPort &ndash; DisplayPort 1.3 &ndash; in to the Thunderbolt 3 standard. Instead they are doubling up on DisplayPort 1.2, expanding the number of equivalent DisplayPort lanes carried from 4 to 8, essentially allowing one Thunderbolt 3 cable to carry 2 full DisplayPort 1.2 connections. The end result is that Thunderbolt 3 will not be able to drive the kind of next-generation displays DisplayPort 1.3 is geared towards &ndash; things like 8K displays and 5K single-tile displays &ndash; but it will be able to drive anything 1 or 2 DisplayPort 1.2 connections can drive today, including multiple 4K@60Hz monitors or 5K multi-tile dispMeanwhile gamers will be happy to hear that Intel is finally moving forward on external graphics via Thunderbolt, and aftermore than a few false start, external GPUs now have the company&rsquo;s blessing and support. While Thunderbolt has in theory always been able of supporting external graphics (it&rsquo;s just a PCIe bus), the biggest hold-up has always been handling what to do about GPU hot-plugging and the so-called &ldquo;surprise removal&rdquo; scenario. Intel tells us that they have since solved that problem, and are now able to move forward with external graphics. The company is initially partnering with AMD on this endeavor &ndash; though nothing excludes NVIDIA in the long-run &ndash; with concepts being floated for both a full power external Thunderbolt card chassis, and a smaller &ldquo;graphics dock&rdquo; which contains a smaller, cooler (but still more powerful than an iGPU) mobile discreteAnother concept Intel has been floating around that will finally be getting some traction with Thunderbolt 3 is Thunderbolt networking. By emulating a 10GigE Ethernet connection, 2 computers can be networked via Thunderbolt cable, and with 10GigE still virtually unseen outside of servers and high-end workstations, this is a somewhat more practical solution for faster-than GigE networking. Thunderbolt networking has been around since 2013 in OS X, and in 2014 Intel demonstrated the technology working on PCs, however since it was a feature added to Thunderbolt 2 after its launch, the number of PCs with the necessary drivers for Thunderbolt networking has been quite low. With Thunderbolt 3 this is now a standard feature at launch, so system support for it should be greMoving on, by building Thunderbolt 3 on top of USB Type-C, Intel is also inheriting Type-C power delivery capabilities, which they will be making ample use of. With Type-C&rsquo;s Power Deliver 2.0 specification allowing for chargers that can supply up to 100W of power, it will be possible (though optional) to use Thunderbolt 3 to deliver that same power, allowing for uses such as having a Thunderbolt dock or display charge a laptop over the single Thunderbolt cable (the one thing Apple&rsquo;s Thunderbolt display can&rsquo;t do today with Thunderbolt 2). That said, the USB power delivery standard is distinct from Thunderbolt&rsquo;s bus power standard, so this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that all Thunderbolt hosts can provide 100W of power, or even any USB charging power for that matter. For standard bus-powered Thunderbolt devices, the Thunderbolt connection will now carry 15W of power, up from 10W for ThunderboFinally, with the change in cabling, Intel is also clarifying how Thunderbolt backwards compatibility will work. Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt adapters will be developed, which in turn will allow Thunderbolt 1/2 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts and devices to interoperate, so that older devices can work on newer hosts, and newer devices can work on older hosts. Though we&rsquo;re not clear at this time whether the adapter is providing a simple bridge between the cable types (with the necessary regeneration), or if there&rsquo;s going to be a complete Alpine Ridge controller in the adaWrapping things up, Intel tells us that they expect to see Thunderbolt 3 products begin shipping by the end of the year, with a larger volume of products in 2016. Given this timing we&rsquo;re almost certain to see Thunderbolt shipping alongside Skylake products, though Intel is making it clear that at a technical level Skylake and Thunderbolt 3 are not interconnected, and that it would be possible to pair Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt 3 controllers with other devices, be it Broadwell, Haswell-E, or other productsAs for whether Intel will see more success with Thunderbolt 3 than the previous versions of Thunderbolt, this remains to be seen.

<title>As PC interest wanes, Computex loses its luster</title><article>Taiwan held its 35th annual Computex trade show this week, and the event hasn’t aged well. There was little news to get excited about, the crowds were thinner, and there were no products on the show floor thatgenerated the buzz seen in years pasTo be sure, Computex has never had theglit andglamo of CES, but for the PC industry it’s the big event of the year. Taiwanese companies make most of the world’s PCs—including those sold under more famous brands—and Computex has been a place where Intel and AMD launch new processors, and where competing memory and interface technologies battle for dominanceBut few people these days wait with bated breath for news of the latest PCs. Smartphones and tablets are where it’s at, along with the apps and services that run on them. The iPhone’s incredible success sent Taiwan’s IT industry in search of a new identity, and it has yet to find oneThis mid-life crisis was evident at the show this week. The island’s two biggest PC makers, Acer and Asus, talked more aboutcloud service andAndroid wearable than their main business of selling laptopsIntel and Microsoft still have a presence, but the show is less important for them than it once was.

<title>The New DRM Graphics Drivers For Linux 4.2: AMDGPU &amp; VirtIO</title><article></articles>
<title>AMD Launches Carrizo: The Laptop Leap of Efficiency and Architecture Updates</title><article>Perform a small test for me. Close your eyes, and spend 15 seconds considering the state of the laptop market and what devices interest you, are available, or on the horizon. Done? Let me hazard a guess &ndash; Apple&rsquo;s offerings loomed large over $800, with $1500+ gaming laptops on the periphery. At $300 we&rsquo;re more in tablet-first space with a mix of cheap clamshell rubbish. In the middle is an assortment of $400-$700 good but not always great mixture of 2-in-1s (like the Surface) or clamshells (like the ASUS UX305), divided mostly on price and features but 95% of them contain Intel. Today&rsquo;s launch of Carrizo by AMD is hoping to change that perception, particularly in $400-$700 and at 15WPreviously when we have mentioned Carrizo, such as when AMD opened the lid on a few important aspectsearlier this yea, all thoughts pointed towards the new core under the hood, Excavator, and if there would be any desktop presence to speak of. As werecently discussed in the latest desktop APU releas from AMD, Excavator is purely a laptop play, and today&rsquo;s release of Carrizo explains a lot about why that is the As with any major processor release, the usual remits ring out in the marketing: better performance, lower power, &lsquo;we want to be the best&rsquo; and so on. A large part of AMD&rsquo;s product launches require understanding of why they release what they do. But as I mentioned at the top of the page, AMD&rsquo;s problem in the laptop space is a result of their competitor taking most of the market, particularly in halo products, big name contracts (Apple) and what you actually see on the shelves. AMD&rsquo;s purpose with the launch of Carrizo, as one would expect, is to change that arAMD&rsquo;s argument is that the notebook/laptop segment accounts for 52% of the revenue in the consumer computing space excluding tablets, with the biggest market of that being $400-$700. As a result, Carrizo was built to be poised to bring competition to this market, and potentially provide premium level performance and a more palatable price range. That being said, in my own opinion, the slide provided by AMD is rather telling. The PC industry is severely fragmented and there is no one single product segment that stands out than others. Even within notebooks, the actual market ranges listed above are about equal, comparing 4-in-10 for the middle segment against 3-in-10 for the others a piece. To borrow analogy from MediaTek, the &lsquo;Super-Mid&rsquo; category where 80% of sales are in the mid-range price for smartphones just doesn&rsquo;t exist in notebooks. It also means it comes across as quite difficult to produce a single product that scales across that large range, and we end up with extremely focused product launches like Carrizo today. That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, as it means the users in that segment end up with that focused, optimized Carrizo is one of three AMD releases this year, with one being the recent launch of Kaveri Refresh desktop APUs (codenamed &lsquo;Godaveri), and the other is Carrizo-L. Carrizo-L is not launched yet, but we know that it is designed to be a counterpart to Carrizo in similar power segments but using AMD&rsquo;s latest &lsquo;Cat&rsquo; core designs which offer a cheaper alternative but are designed to be almost plug-and-play with Carrizo as they both have the same socket. We will have more information on Carrizo-L later in the Carrizo&rsquo;s goals are simple, and should apply to A8, A10 and FX (yes, mobile FX) processors. The big things here are the price, keeping in the $400 to $700 as the mainstay, and the &lsquo;all day unplugged&rsquo; performance. Notice the asterisk there, and the small text stating &lsquo;all day defined as &gt;8 hrs idle battery life&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m sure a few of our readers snickered at that a little bit, as did I the first time I read it, but let&rsquo;s be serious for a moment &ndash; this is the position AMD is coming from, and perhaps it is a little concerning that the world&rsquo;s second largest consumer x86 processor manufacturer can&rsquo;t get an elbow into the laptop space due to how quickly the user experience method of evaluating things, such as how long a charge lasts, compared to the iterative cycle of processor updates. That speaks volumes regarding strategy and targeting, both of which have been key points in discussing AMD so far this decade. But this slide indicates that AMD is pursuing the path that indicating what bare minimum requirements should be. An issue with that is down to the OEMs though &ndash; a good processor in a bad design is a bad product afterRather than write about markets and concepts for this entire article, I want to go through some of the architecture changes AMD has bought with Carrizo, but first we come to high level performance. We should note that the numbers here are all solely provided by AMD, as we have not had a chance to test the systems ourselves yet. We have some exciting plans in the works to cover the performance in depth in due course, so stay tuned for that, but first the above slide indicates some of what AMD hopes to provide with CarrizoCarrizo will be a 15W focused part, with the A10 and FX models having an additional 35W mode although this will be at the discretion of the OEM. This makes life a little difficult, as the name of the processor is no-longer the clarification of performance and I&rsquo;d hazard a guess and say that OEMs will not put &lsquo;15W&rsquo; or &lsquo;35W&rsquo; in front of their naming regimes. Nevertheless, AMD&rsquo;s provided results comparing their 15W APUs to some of Intel&#39;s 15W CPUs, and in those results the 15W APUs compare favorably. The Intel parts are HD 5500 graphics, with 24 execution units (the i3 has 23). It is worth noting that Intel also offers 15W SKUs with the higher-frequency 24EU HD 6000, so the HD 5500 AMD is comparing themselves against is not Intel&#39;s most powerful iGPU. That said (and in all fairness to AMD) this isn&#39;t AMD&#39;s doing but rather the OEMs&#39;; since none of the OEMs have shipped any 15W HD 6000-equipped products, AMD has not been able to look at HD 6000&#39;s performance. Similarly, Intel offers a 28W Iris 6100 range of processors, but these too are not in products that AMD could test. I would imagine that the team that wins when those come out would be first to publish benchmark results. But overall the 15W target is AMD&rsquo;s main focus At AMD&rsquo;s Tech Day a couple of weeks ago, they did have a few Carrizo laptops on display. There were fairly non-descript clamshells made by an OEM but with the latest spin of the APU inside. All but one of the units were running on integrated graphics, but the other also held the R7 M365 GPU which could be used in dual graphics mode with the 8000-series APU to give the R7 M370DX (D for dual). Unfortunately we weren&rsquo;t allowed to perform hands on testing at the time, and the slide above doesn&rsquo;t match up the percentage increase for DIRT, but Starcraft&rsquo;s numbers at least show a bump over 30 FPS when moving into dual graphics mode.&nbsp; Dual graphics will become more important when DX12 comes along, as Carrizo will support Asymmetric Rendering, allowing each GPU in the system to be a render target depending on the strength of the GPU, rather than the cobbled together Crossfire way we do things nowOne of Carrizo&rsquo;s strengths lies in the video decoder and the path for which video takes through the SoC. By minimizing data transfers, increasing the bandwidth for the unified video decoder and the onboard HEVC decode IP that makes it the only x86 SoC with a full HEVC code pipeline, battery life is increased substantially, according toWe go into more detail on the next pages when discussing the architecture updates, but AMD is stating that their improvements to the whole video pipeline from loading into memory and playback will aid both battery life and the experience. For 10Mbps 1080p HEVC content, AMD is stating 300 minutes of unplugged playback time on Carrizo compared to 112 minutes with Kaveri. It is worth stating that the systems used a 13x7 eDP panel using PowerDVD14, with the system power of the 15W TDP Carrizo-based system at 10.02 W (12.6% CPU utilization), giving 299.4 minutes on a 50 Wh battery, using DDR3-1600 memory. The Kaveri system, also 15W TDP based using DDR3-2133, used 32% CPU utilization averaging 26.72W for 112 minutes on the same battery. That&rsquo;s a big step, and I would be interested to see if the memory made a difference thereHEVC still is not the normal way of delivery video yet as H264 still remains king. AMD performed the same test using the same equipment above using the H264 clip of Big Buck Bunny to arrive at 8.3 hours playback for Carrizo against 3.3 hours with Kaveri. This is down to a number of things, but the UVD now has 4x the bandwidth, allowing 1080p frames to be decoded in 1/4 of the time, forcing a race Carrizo is designed to have full HSA 1.0 compliance, assuming the standard doesn&rsquo;t change between now and users getting devices into their hands. As with the &#39;HSA ready&#39;&nbsp;Kaveri APUs, the weight of potential with OpenCL to use the heterogeneous system architecture is something that AMD needs to exploit in order to promote more positive experiences. Needless to say, AMD has been doing thisOne feature AMD presented is a new piece of software called Looking Glass. This uses HSA enabled through OpenCL to essentially perform video tagging for faces. It will recognize common people in your videos, and tell you where in those videos those people are. One example of this is to keep track of home videos, most of which usually end up un-named, and allows users to have a quick reference to what videos John or Jill are in, then collates them to be used in other programs such as video ediThis has archival potential as well, and although personally I am not much of a video taker I do see the merits in such a system and can understand that processing through video frames, running facial recognition algorithms on each is both a compute and memory intensive process that something such as HSA canWindows 10 acceleration is also in AMD&rsquo;s plans, particularly revolving around the HEVC decode pathway in the APU. Anything that involves video playback or streaming is ripe for this, although I would imagine the major players having both feet in this concrete well before it sets down to the mainstCarrizo also comes with security though a built in Cortex-A5 processor into the die. This divides out memory and processing to allow a complete secure ARM TrustZone element separate from the main CPU cores and memory. AMD&rsquo;s focus on this, quite understandably, is busiAt the other end of the spectrum, for consumers, AMD is bundling codes for Batman 3 or DIRT Rally with their APUs to OEMs, although I would imagine it is up to the OEM to pass this on as part of their proDespite today being the official launch of Carrizo, AMD has been tight lipped on exactly what SKUs will be in the market, how the segregation of products plays out, or even when OEMs are expected to bring them to market. At this point, Carrizo is more or less a paper launch showing off capabilities but nothing concrete we can yet play with in our hands. That being said, this week is Computex and I imagine some OEMs will be showing off some models (either on the show floor or behind closed doAMD&rsquo;s biggest problem is still what I mentioned at the start &ndash; visibility. There are forums where users discuss where to find laptops with particular versions of AMD&rsquo;s APUs, or what might be available in what markets. When you&rsquo;re in a situation where users are struggling to find stock of your product, having to ask others to ship overseas or having to pre-order with retailers and befriend someone who works for that business, then something is up. Personally, I believe it comes down to the OEM perception of AMD in the laptop space. They are still seen as the budget play, prone to temperature issues and unresponsive for all but basic tasks. Sometimes it can be hard to break that perception, even with an aggressive marketing campaign or even providing samples to OEMs to test themselves &ndash; the competition is a known source. AMD needs a stable supply of good products in order to inject some knowledge into the ecosystem, and nothing comes better than a design win, but there is no obvious pursuant at this point. Reviewers have the same issues when it comes to sampling. OEMs and companies want us to test their high end halos, to experience a trickle-down effect, rather than a mid-range product. A bad review of a high-end product could cost some sales, but a bad review of something with more volume could mean a revenue reduction noticeable on the balance sheets. This is something we are hoping to change around, particularly if AMD&rsquo;s claims about Carrizo hold waterAs part of AMD&rsquo;s Carrizo launch, several select media were invited to a specialist Technology Day a couple of weeks beforehand for an architecture deep-dive with Joe Macri, CVP Product CTO and Sam Neffziger, an AMD Corporate Fellow, about Carrizo. I want to cover what they explained with a few thoughts on the next few pagePerform a small test for me. Close your eyes, and spend 15 seconds considering the state of the laptop market and what devices interest you, are available, or on the horizon. Done? Let me hazard a guess &ndash; Apple&rsquo;s offerings loomed large over $800, with $1500+ gaming laptops on the periphery. At $300 we&rsquo;re more in tablet-first space with a mix of cheap clamshell rubbish. In the middle is an assortment of $400-$700 good but not always great mixture of 2-in-1s (like the Surface) or clamshells (like the ASUS UX305), divided mostly on price and features but 95% of them contain Intel. Today&rsquo;s launch of Carrizo by AMD is hoping to change that perception, particularly in $400-$700 and at 15WPreviously when we have mentioned Carrizo, such as when AMD opened the lid on a few important aspectsearlier this yea, all thoughts pointed towards the new core under the hood, Excavator, and if there would be any desktop presence to speak of. As werecently discussed in the latest desktop APU releas from AMD, Excavator is purely a laptop play, and today&rsquo;s release of Carrizo explains a lot about why that is the As with any major processor release, the usual remits ring out in the marketing: better performance, lower power, &lsquo;we want to be the best&rsquo; and so on. A large part of AMD&rsquo;s product launches require understanding of why they release what they do. But as I mentioned at the top of the page, AMD&rsquo;s problem in the laptop space is a result of their competitor taking most of the market, particularly in halo products, big name contracts (Apple) and what you actually see on the shelves. AMD&rsquo;s purpose with the launch of Carrizo, as one would expect, is to change that arAMD&rsquo;s argument is that the notebook/laptop segment accounts for 52% of the revenue in the consumer computing space excluding tablets, with the biggest market of that being $400-$700. As a result, Carrizo was built to be poised to bring competition to this market, and potentially provide premium level performance and a more palatable price range. That being said, in my own opinion, the slide provided by AMD is rather telling. The PC industry is severely fragmented and there is no one single product segment that stands out than others. Even within notebooks, the actual market ranges listed above are about equal, comparing 4-in-10 for the middle segment against 3-in-10 for the others a piece. To borrow analogy from MediaTek, the &lsquo;Super-Mid&rsquo; category where 80% of sales are in the mid-range price for smartphones just doesn&rsquo;t exist in notebooks. It also means it comes across as quite difficult to produce a single product that scales across that large range, and we end up with extremely focused product launches like Carrizo today. That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, as it means the users in that segment end up with that focused, optimized Carrizo is one of three AMD releases this year, with one being the recent launch of Kaveri Refresh desktop APUs (codenamed &lsquo;Godaveri), and the other is Carrizo-L. Carrizo-L is not launched yet, but we know that it is designed to be a counterpart to Carrizo in similar power segments but using AMD&rsquo;s latest &lsquo;Cat&rsquo; core designs which offer a cheaper alternative but are designed to be almost plug-and-play with Carrizo as they both have the same socket. We will have more information on Carrizo-L later in the Carrizo&rsquo;s goals are simple, and should apply to A8, A10 and FX (yes, mobile FX) processors. The big things here are the price, keeping in the $400 to $700 as the mainstay, and the &lsquo;all day unplugged&rsquo; performance. Notice the asterisk there, and the small text stating &lsquo;all day defined as &gt;8 hrs idle battery life&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m sure a few of our readers snickered at that a little bit, as did I the first time I read it, but let&rsquo;s be serious for a moment &ndash; this is the position AMD is coming from, and perhaps it is a little concerning that the world&rsquo;s second largest consumer x86 processor manufacturer can&rsquo;t get an elbow into the laptop space due to how quickly the user experience method of evaluating things, such as how long a charge lasts, compared to the iterative cycle of processor updates. That speaks volumes regarding strategy and targeting, both of which have been key points in discussing AMD so far this decade. But this slide indicates that AMD is pursuing the path that indicating what bare minimum requirements should be. An issue with that is down to the OEMs though &ndash; a good processor in a bad design is a bad product afterRather than write about markets and concepts for this entire article, I want to go through some of the architecture changes AMD has bought with Carrizo, but first we come to high level performance.

<title>Microsoft tries to guess relatives with &#039;Twins or Not&#039;</title><article>
Microsoft is now giving people a chance to settle arguments about whether they have a doppelganger once and for all with anew website called “Twins or Not.
The service, launched Friday, lets people upload a pair of photos to the web and get back a similarity score that ranges from completely unrelated to “OMG, clones!!!” It’s powered by Microsoft’s Project Oxford Face API, which lets developers handle image recognition problems, like determining whether people are related, by using the company’s Azure cloud platform. This is another novel use of Microsoft’s image recognition technology, which the company first put on display with the”How Old do I Look? website that it launched at its Build developer conference in late April.
That website went viral after it became clear that its predictions were often inaccurate—at times, hilariously so. Some limited tests of Twins or Not turned up interesting results, likeone clai that Microsoft’s Operating Systems Group Corporate Vice President Joe Belfiore and HoloLens mastermind Alex Kipman were “definitely related.” Twins or Not said that Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were a perfect match—hardly surprising, since the identical twins played one character on the TV show “Full House.”
In ablog post explaining Twins or No, Microsoft Senior Software Development Engineer Mat Velloso said that he coded the service in four hours based on an example included in the Face API software development kit. Technically speaking, the name of the site is a bit of a misnomer, since Twins or Not seeks similarities between the faces it’s asked to compare but doesn’t seem honed to specifically detect twins, except insofar as they look similar.
Twins or Not was designed as a demo for Microsoft’s Build Tour stop in Prague to show how easy it is for developers to build applications using the Face APIs and publish them to the web. It’s part of the company’s broader push to drive adoption of its cloud services, especially the designated machine learning offerings that Microsoft has built.

<title>PayPal users may get break on unsolicited robocalls, texts</title><article>After a backlash from critics, PayPal seems to be reconsidering a plan to give itself unilateral permission to ping its users with robocalls and text messagesThe controversy started when PayPal recently indicated inproposed amendment to its user agreement and privacy policy its intention to engage in this type of communication with its customers. There, it also stated that the only opt-out recourse for those in disagreement with its plan would be to close their accountsThe plan drew attention from critics who, in blogs andon social medi, questioned the prudence and legality of the new policy, which is slated to go into effect July 1. If the changes are adopted, PayPal would be able to make autodialed and prerecorded calls, and send text messages using any telephone number account holders have provided to PayPal or that the company has “otherwise obtained.PayPal says it may contact users for numerous reasons, which include troubleshooting account problems, resolving disputes and collecting debts. But the calls may also be made to advertise offers and promotions, or to conduct user surveysFederal Communications Commissionrule state that unsolicited robocalls are only legal if a company has obtained written or oral consent from consumers. In a post on financial education and services siteCredit.co, syndicated columnist, book author and self-described consumer advocate Bob Sullivan questioned whether a change in PayPal’s terms legally constitutes consentPlus, the policy, as it reads, provides no way for users to opt out, aside fromclosing their accounBut on Friday, a PayPal spokesman sang a different tune.

<title>AMD Demonstrates FreeSync-over-HDMI Concept Hardware at Computex 2015</title><article>While AMD wasn&rsquo;t the first GPU vendor to implement a system for variable refresh, the company has made up for lost time with zeal. Since demonstrating their FreeSync proof-of-concept laptop demo back at CES 2014, AMD has since been able to get the necessary signaling and refresh technology implemented into the DisplayPort standard as an optional annex of 1.2a, more commonly knownDisplayPort Adaptive-Syn. With DPAS implemented into monitors,AMD has been able to roll out their FreeSync implementation of variable refresh back in March of this yea, when the first DPAS-enabled monitors shippedSince then AMD has been relatively quiet (no doubt gearing up for their big GPU launch). However as it turns out they have been hard at work at expanding FreeSync past the realm of DisplayPort monitors, and they are for the first time showing off that technology at their suite at Computex 2015AMD&#39;s demonstration and the big revelation from the company is that they now have a prototype implementation of FreeSync-over-HDMI up and running. Powered by an R9 200 series card (we&#39;d wager 290X), AMD&#39;s demonstration involved running their windmill FreeSync demo against the prototype FreeSync-enabled HDMI monitor to showcase the viability of FreeSync-over-We wasted no time in tracking down AMD&#39;s Robert Hallock for more details, and while AMD isn&#39;t being super deep at this time &ndash; it&rsquo;s a proof-of-concept prototype after all &ndash; we do have a basic understanding of what they are up toThe monitor in question is running a Realtek TCON, with AMD and Realtek developing the prototype together. The TCON itself is by all indications a bog-standard TCON (i.e. not custom hardware), with the only difference being that Realtek has developed a custom firmware for it to support variable refresh operation and the FreeSync-over-HDMI technologyOn the signaling side, AMD tells us that they&#39;re running a custom protocol over HDMI 1.4a. As one might expect, the necessary functionality doesn&#39;t currently exist in HDMI, so AMD went and added the necessary functionality to their driver and the Realtek firmware in order for both ends to operate. Compared to FreeSync-over-DisplayPort all other operation is the same from what we&#39;re told, so the end result is the same kind of variable refresh support currently found in DPAS-enabled monitors, except now over HDMI instead of DisplayPortThe goal here from AMD is very similar to what they did with DisplayPort last year. The company wants to introduce variable refresh support into the HDMI standard, making it a standardized (and common) feature of HDMI. The payoff for AMD and their users would be that getting variable refresh support into HDMI would allow FreeSync to potentially work with many more monitors, as DisplayPort is not found in all monitors whereas HDMI is. This is especially the case in cheaper monitors, which of course make up the bulk of monitor salesBecause AMD has been working with Realtek on this, it was unknown if other TCON manufacturers would have issues writing firmware. However if variable refresh were implemented into the HDMI standard, then there&#39;s no reason to believe it wouldn&#39;t eventually be a solved issue. Meanwhile the fact that Realtek is doing this via custom firmware on a standard TCON does technically open up the possibility of flashing existing monitors to enable such functionality, but given the fact that this hasn&#39;t happened for DisplayPort monitors, it&#39;s unlikely here as wellIn any case, AMD isn&#39;t saying too much else at this time. With a proof-of-concept up and running, AMD can now begin attempting to influence the necessary parties to add the feature to HDMI, and to get customers demanding the technologyAlong with the FreeSync-over-HDMI demo, AMD also had one bit of FreeSync news at Computex. As regular readers are likely aware, all of the current DPAS monitors have a minimum refresh rate over 30Hz &ndash; typically 40Hz or 48Hz &ndash; which unfortunately for AMD&rsquo;s FreeSync efforts is counterproductive to their goals since you lose the bulk of the benefits of FreeSync when framerates fall below the minimum refresh rate. And although this is a monitor limitation rather than a DPAS/FreeSync limitation, AMD is still looking to push vendors to get lower minimum rate monitors on the market and to promote those moniTo that end, monitor vendor Nixeus has announced the first 30hz minimum refresh rate DPAS monitor, the NX-VUE24. The NX-VUE24 is a 24&rdquo;, 1080p TN display that supports variable refresh rates from 30Hz up to 144Hz. A 1080p TN monitor is admittedly not likely to set the world on fire at this point, but it&rsquo;s still an important milestone in getting 30Hz-minimum DPAS displays out in to the market. And at 1080p and just 24&rdquo;, this will likely be the most affordable/cheapest variable refresh monitor yeUpdat: We also have confirmation thatthe NX-VUE24 supports pixel overdriNixeus has not yet announced a release date or price for the monitor, but they tell us it should be coming soonFinally, while we had a chance to talk to AMD about FreeSync, we asked them aboutsome of the barbs NVIDIA has been flinging their way latel, particularly on the subject matter of minimum refresh rates and pixel overdrive. Though NVIDIA is not above poking at AMD when it suits them, these were still important points that we wanted to hear AMD&#39;s answer toOn the matter of pixel overdrive, AMD has clarified that pixel overdrive can work with FreeSync, but it is up to the monitor manufactures. DPAS/FreeSync doesn&rsquo;t offer any control over overdrive to the video card, so whether any overdrive happens is up to the monitor manufacturer, who would need to implement it in their scaler. Ultimately pixel overdrive is not a required part of the DPAS standard, so its presence is going to be on a monitor-by-monitor basis, and the quality of any overdrive solution is up to the vendor. As with NVIDIA&rsquo;s solution, this all boils down to doing frame delivery prediction and adjusting their overdrive values accordingly, with DPAS monitor manufacturers needing to do that in their scaler as part of their per-frame operations (just as how it works today on fixed refresh rate moniMeanwhile on the subject of minimum refresh rates, AMD&rsquo;s comments were a bit less concrete, but also a bit more optimistic. How minimum refresh periods are handled is ultimately up to FreeSync; there needs to be a refresh within the maximum pixel decay period in order to maintain the display, but it&rsquo;s up to AMD how they want to do those refreshes. For 144Hz monitors this can mean just running a quick refresh over 7ms, whereas for 60Hz monitors the subject is a bit trickier since a refresh takes 16msIn any case the message from AMD has been that they have the ability to change their minimum refresh behavior as they see fit or as they develop better ways to handle the situation. However absent any concrete details at this time, all we can do is wait and see if and when AMD makes any changes. AMD clearly isn&rsquo;t wanting to commit to anything right now, at least not until they have something ready to deploWhile AMD wasn&rsquo;t the first GPU vendor to implement a system for variable refresh, the company has made up for lost time with zeal. Since demonstrating their FreeSync proof-of-concept laptop demo back at CES 2014, AMD has since been able to get the necessary signaling and refresh technology implemented into the DisplayPort standard as an optional annex of 1.2a, more commonly knownDisplayPort Adaptive-Syn. With DPAS implemented into monitors,AMD has been able to roll out their FreeSync implementation of variable refresh back in March of this yea, when the first DPAS-enabled monitors shippedSince then AMD has been relatively quiet (no doubt gearing up for their big GPU launch). However as it turns out they have been hard at work at expanding FreeSync past the realm of DisplayPort monitors, and they are for the first time showing off that technology at their suite at Computex 2015AMD&#39;s demonstration and the big revelation from the company is that they now have a prototype implementation of FreeSync-over-HDMI up and running. Powered by an R9 200 series card (we&#39;d wager 290X), AMD&#39;s demonstration involved running their windmill FreeSync demo against the prototype FreeSync-enabled HDMI monitor to showcase the viability of FreeSync-over-We wasted no time in tracking down AMD&#39;s Robert Hallock for more details, and while AMD isn&#39;t being super deep at this time &ndash; it&rsquo;s a proof-of-concept prototype after all &ndash; we do have a basic understanding of what they are up toThe monitor in question is running a Realtek TCON, with AMD and Realtek developing the prototype together. The TCON itself is by all indications a bog-standard TCON (i.e. not custom hardware), with the only difference being that Realtek has developed a custom firmware for it to support variable refresh operation and the FreeSync-over-HDMI technologyOn the signaling side, AMD tells us that they&#39;re running a custom protocol over HDMI 1.4a. As one might expect, the necessary functionality doesn&#39;t currently exist in HDMI, so AMD went and added the necessary functionality to their driver and the Realtek firmware in order for both ends to operate. Compared to FreeSync-over-DisplayPort all other operation is the same from what we&#39;re told, so the end result is the same kind of variable refresh support currently found in DPAS-enabled monitors, except now over HDMI instead of DisplayPortThe goal here from AMD is very similar to what they did with DisplayPort last year. The company wants to introduce variable refresh support into the HDMI standard, making it a standardized (and common) feature of HDMI. The payoff for AMD and their users would be that getting variable refresh support into HDMI would allow FreeSync to potentially work with many more monitors, as DisplayPort is not found in all monitors whereas HDMI is. This is especially the case in cheaper monitors, which of course make up the bulk of monitor salesBecause AMD has been working with Realtek on this, it was unknown if other TCON manufacturers would have issues writing firmware. However if variable refresh were implemented into the HDMI standard, then there&#39;s no reason to believe it wouldn&#39;t eventually be a solved issue. Meanwhile the fact that Realtek is doing this via custom firmware on a standard TCON does technically open up the possibility of flashing existing monitors to enable such functionality, but given the fact that this hasn&#39;t happened for DisplayPort monitors, it&#39;s unlikely here as wellIn any case, AMD isn&#39;t saying too much else at this time. With a proof-of-concept up and running, AMD can now begin attempting to influence the necessary parties to add the feature to HDMI, and to get customers demanding the technologyAlong with the FreeSync-over-HDMI demo, AMD also had one bit of FreeSync news at Computex. As regular readers are likely aware, all of the current DPAS monitors have a minimum refresh rate over 30Hz &ndash; typically 40Hz or 48Hz &ndash; which unfortunately for AMD&rsquo;s FreeSync efforts is counterproductive to their goals since you lose the bulk of the benefits of FreeSync when framerates fall below the minimum refresh rate. And although this is a monitor limitation rather than a DPAS/FreeSync limitation, AMD is still looking to push vendors to get lower minimum rate monitors on the market and to promote those moniTo that end, monitor vendor Nixeus has announced the first 30hz minimum refresh rate DPAS monitor, the NX-VUE24. The NX-VUE24 is a 24&rdquo;, 1080p TN display that supports variable refresh rates from 30Hz up to 144Hz. A 1080p TN monitor is admittedly not likely to set the world on fire at this point, but it&rsquo;s still an important milestone in getting 30Hz-minimum DPAS displays out in to the market. And at 1080p and just 24&rdquo;, this will likely be the most affordable/cheapest variable refresh monitor yeUpdat: We also have confirmation thatthe NX-VUE24 supports pixel overdriNixeus has not yet announced a release date or price for the monitor, but they tell us it should be coming soonFinally, while we had a chance to talk to AMD about FreeSync, we asked them aboutsome of the barbs NVIDIA has been flinging their way latel, particularly on the subject matter of minimum refresh rates and pixel overdrive. Though NVIDIA is not above poking at AMD when it suits them, these were still important points that we wanted to hear AMD&#39;s answer toOn the matter of pixel overdrive, AMD has clarified that pixel overdrive can work with FreeSync, but it is up to the monitor manufactures. DPAS/FreeSync doesn&rsquo;t offer any control over overdrive to the video card, so whether any overdrive happens is up to the monitor manufacturer, who would need to implement it in their scaler. Ultimately pixel overdrive is not a required part of the DPAS standard, so its presence is going to be on a monitor-by-monitor basis, and the quality of any overdrive solution is up to the vendor. As with NVIDIA&rsquo;s solution, this all boils down to doing frame delivery prediction and adjusting their overdrive values accordingly, with DPAS monitor manufacturers needing to do that in their scaler as part of their per-frame operations (just as how it works today on fixed refresh rate moniMeanwhile on the subject of minimum refresh rates, AMD&rsquo;s comments were a bit less concrete, but also a bit more optimistic. How minimum refresh periods are handled is ultimately up to FreeSync; there needs to be a refresh within the maximum pixel decay period in order to maintain the display, but it&rsquo;s up to AMD how they want to do those refreshes. For 144Hz monitors this can mean just running a quick refresh over 7ms, whereas for 60Hz monitors the subject is a bit trickier since a refresh takes 16msIn any case the message from AMD has been that they have the ability to change their minimum refresh behavior as they see fit or as they develop better ways to handle the situation. However absent any concrete details at this time, all we can do is wait and see if and when AMD makes any changes. AMD clearly isn&rsquo;t wanting to commit to anything right now, at least not until they have something ready to deploy.</articles>
<title>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (PC) review: An utter masterpiece that reveals the fundamental flaws in open-world games</title><article>The Witcher  is a masterpiece. It is without a doubt one of the best open-world RPGs I’ve ever played. It is bigger in scope than almost any singleplayer game I’ve played (except maybeBaldur’s Gate I). It offers the freedom ofMorrowin, the story intensity ofPlanescape: TormentorFallout: New Vega, the atmosphere ofFallout —it's nothing short of a landmark achievement in open-world RPGs.
It is also, without a doubt, flawed. The best open-world RPG ever produced simultaneously proves that the entire genre is, at its core, broken. Can it be fixed? I don’t know.The Witcher  certainly takes some steps in the right direction. But for every open-world trope it skillfully sidesteps (and it sidesteps alotof them), it falls into another with the same headlong stupidity aDragon Age: Inquisiti, aAssassin’s Creed Uni, aWatch_Do.The Witcher 3 is best-in-class, a genre-defining game, a landmark achievement. But landmarks don’t just show you how far you’ve come. They show how much further you’ve left to go.
EverythingWitcher  does right comes back to a central theme: World-building.The Witcher  justifies its open-world format. It’s not the first game to have done so, but it certainly works the hardest at it.The Witcher 3is full of life, full of people commenting on your actions whether or not you pay attention, full of tiny stories and tiny details many players won’t even notice. It rewards exploration while maintaining a strong core story.
Contrast that with some other open-world games.Dragon Age: Inquisitio artificially gated approximately fifteen hours of main story with forty or fifty (or more!) hours of pointless filler.Fallout  andNew Vegasjustified their open-worlds, but only because youexpecte a post-nuclear wasteland to be…well, mostly empty and devoid of life.Baldur’s Gate I built a world of enormous size and scope, but it wasn’t very flexible or reactive.Assassin’s Cree just throws icons at a map as if that makes for a compelling world, when really it just highlights howdea every unplanned encounter feels.The Witcher  is not an “open-world.” It is a world. Do characters always react appropriately? No. Do some of the programmed reactions get old after a while? Sure. You’ll undoubtedly notice that early on, when you enter the town of White Orchard for the dozenth time and run past the same damn kid singing the same annoying song for the dozenth time and getting grounded for the dozenth time.
But in general,The Witcher  does a remarkable job mimicking a living world around the titular witcher (read: professional monster-hunter) Geralt—and does so without making Geralt conspicuously the focus.
The RPG is an old and entrenched genre, and at its core is the idea that the playeris the characte. To make a good RPG, conventional wisdom says strip away as much “character” as possible and let the player impose his or her own personality.The Witcher series undermines this by forcing you to play as Geralt, and some people will understandably be driven away by this. “I don’t want to play as some growly old white dude,” you might say.
But the tradeoff is that you gethistor. You get motivations that extend beyond the simplistic “save the world” crap every RPG falls into. Ironically,The Witcher  is centered around saving the world—but not to Geralt. Because we’re seeing these events through his eyes, it reduces the stakes to something more human. “Save my daughter.” “Save the love of my life.” “Save my friends.” “Get the emperor off my back.” “Live long enough to retire.”
Not every person in the world knows or cares who Geralt is. Some outright despise him without even meeting him. He’s neither the most powerful person in the world nor the most renowned. He’s a freak. A mutant. He’s a burden. He’s a savior. However you play Geralt, life in these villages goes on. Sometimes the most valid response to a situation is to stand back and do nothing at all, although the old tenet still holds true: If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.
Nobody will “remember that,” though. The game doesn’t call out what you did. It doesn’t pass judgment. You either did something you feel comfortable with, or you did something you later regret. Most times you’re stuck choosing the lesser of two equally terrible options. Sometimes there are consequences. Sometimes there aren’t. Either way, the game proceeds.
Take this trivial one-off encounter, for example:
Early on I was riding my horse down the road—flanked on both sides by hanged corpses—when I came across a group of angry peasants surrounding a lone soldier, part of an invading force. The peasants insisted the foreigner be lynched. I told them to back off. The peasants attacked. I killed them all.
“Thanks so much,” said the soldier. “So lucky you stopped by.”
“If I hadn’t stopped, only one man would’ve died here today,” said Geralt.
And I felt bad. So bad that I succumbed to the perennial video game advantage—I reloaded. This time I let the soldier die. When the peasants walked away, there was one more corpse hanging by the side of the road. I looted the soldier, only to find a letter from his wife desperately begging him to come home.
I reloaded again. I killed the peasants.
I don’t know if there’s a consequence to either action. I don’t know if it’s ever revisited. If it is, I missed it. But that sort of morally-gray choice is rare in games, and inThe Witcher 3it’s a feature of nearly every quest, nearly every random encounter. It’s what makes even simple “Go here, kill this” quests a bit more complicated (and thus more engaging) than games likeDragon Ag where the “kill this” part of the quest is literally your only motivation.
And that’s apart from the side quests thatd have consequences. There are plenty of side quests inWitcher  you would swear were part of the main story, were it not for the fact they’re categorized under “Secondary Quests” in the menu.
You could honestly spend days picking apartThe Witcher  and discussing what makes it work so much better than other open-world games. It’s the fact the game doesn’t highlightevery singl location or quest on the map, thus rewarding off-the-beaten-path exploration. It’s running through town and hearing two characters wondering where someone from their village disappeared to. Someone you know for a fact is dead. It’s blowing Geralt’s cover because you never bothered to play the card-based minigame Gwent in the preceding twenty or so hours, and as a result you’ll need to kill your way through a house instead of bluffing your way to the boss.
It can even be as simple as Geralt getting drunk with old pals, spending the night rehashing old brawls and talking about what they’ve all been up to. This living world—this sense of a past and a future—is what makesThe Witcher  a genre-defining game.
On the other hand,The Witcher ’s excellence casts the genre’s stupidest flaws into stark relief. And I don’t just mean the fact that all open-world games (includingWitcher ) are incredibly buggy.
It’s the same old garbage we’ve seen time and time again. You’re dealing with an end-of-the-world crisis, but first you’re going to spend five hours becoming the international boxing champion of Velen, Novigrad, and Skellige. Your daughter Ciri couldliterally di at any moment—Geralt says this over and over—but for some reason you’re determined to make some side-cash taking care of petty monsters for random villagers. The stakes havenever been highe, but…well, is there really any harm in taking a few days to participate in horse racing?
Make no mistake—for the most part, CD Projekt’s side quests are better written than any other open-world game I’ve played. Geralt’s motivations are well-explained. Many of them put a twist on the go-here-kill-that formula, as I said. The characters involved are by-and-large interesting and worth meeting. I have no complaints with theconten of these quests, for the most part.
It’s theexistenc of these side-quests that’s baffling. It destroys the pacing of the main story. Every time a character says how “urgent” something is you can laugh, safe in the knowledge that there will in actuality be no consequence to puttering around the countryside for ten hours killing bears. Or spelunking in empty caves because, I don’t know, maybe somebody dropped a sword in there a few decades ago?
Here’s the catch-22: You can’t have an open-world without filling it with side content. You can’t have the side content without devaluing the stakes of the main story. It is a genre that isat its cor fundamentally broken. For every stepThe Witcher  takes towards rectifying this—fleshing out those side stories, giving Geralt a purpose—it simultaneously proves the industry’s whole approach to the genre is wrongheaded.
Another example: Loot. There are multiple moments inThe Witcher —supposedly poignant moments—where a friend rewards you with a priceless item. For instance, a sword that has “been in the family for generations,” or “a one-of-a-kind sword made solely for you.”
In real life this would be a huge deal. Can you imagine if you helped someone and they were so emotionally overcome by your grace and humility that they offered you a one-of-a-kind family heirloom?Centurie. That’s how incredible this sword is. Until it’s in my inventory.
InThe Witcher , the item in question drops into your inventory and becomes one more piece of useless loot cluttering your saddlebags. The family heirloom sword? I walked down the hallway and sold it for about 300 gold. The sword that one guy made me? I literallysold it back to hi. “Yeah, thanks very much for making thispiece of garbag for me. Now if you could just give me money for it. I don’t want it.”
These are genre tropes. You can say it doesn’t bother you. You can say “Well I don’t even notice that,” and that’s fine. But it doesn’t change the existence of said problems. In a game the quality ofWitcher , where so many stupid,stupi tropes have been sidestepped, it exacerbates the issue. The lazy garbage open-world games get away with becomes all the more apparent when someone actively tries to fix some of the genre’s most egregious issues.The Witcher  is maybe the best open-world RPG ever made. I don’t say that lightly. This is my favorite genre, and my history with it stretches back nearly two decades.
But my patience with the genre wears somewhat thin. The promise of the open-world is more natural (and more engrossing) stories. Rather than being shuttled place to place, we’re allowed toliv a character.
In reality, the open-world genre has made linear narrative hooks even more obvious, while exacerbating the issue by undercutting any sense of stakes, of pacing, ofthe things stories typically rely o.The Witcher ’s main story is padded by hours of riding a horse across fields, of playing cards and participating in backroom brawls and running errands for villagers. And that (excellently-written) filler serves a purpose—it grounds Geralt in the world, lets us identify with him and his lifestyle as a player.
It’s a masquerade, though. At the end of the day there’s still a “main story,” regardless of how much CD Projekt tries to weave the various strings of Geralt’s “life” together. And those strings just don’twantto weave together—the stakes set up by one half are directly at odds with the leisurely pace of the other half.
The result: I’m convincedThe Witcher  is near the top of some sort of plateaued curve. Like, at some point based on the amount of resources a developer can conceivably throw at a game, the amount of man-hours that can go into its creation, et cetera, we will have a “best open-world RPG.”The Witcher  is near that point. It does so many things better than its predecessors.
But there are still tons of issues, and the issues left over are things inherent to the way developers approach the genre. There is no “fix.” Not if we keep trying to reinvent a square wheel.Hayden writes about games for PCWorld and doubles as the resident Zork enthusiasMore bHayden DinUse commas to separate multiple email addresseYour message has been sentThere was an error emailing this pagHardcore Hardware: CyberPower Trinity Xtre

    Themost affordabl, the $500 Syber Steam Machine A, packs an Athlon X4 850 processor, a 2GB Radeon
    R9 270, 4GB of memory, and 500GB of storage. At the high end, the $1,400 Syber Steam Machine packs a full-blown Core i7-4790K, a GeForce GTX 980 graphics
    card, 8GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. It’s hard to find components more capable than that, folks.
    Syber will also craft you a Steam Machine from the hardware of your choice if the premade models don’t cut if for youGigabyte’s $600 Brix Pr is different from other Steam Machines in that, well, it doesn’t come with SteamOS preinstalled.

This Steam Machine opts for some snazzy touches, like a unibody aluminum chassis and closed-loop liquid cooling design to chill your hardware without making a racketSpecific configurations vary. Up to an Intel Core i7-4690K will be offered, along with graphics cards all the way up to the GTX 980 and Radeon R9 290X.

(It looks like several cases will be offered, going by the Steam listing's images.) Processor support tops out with the Core i7-4770K, while up to 32GB of RAM and a whopping14 terabyte of storage will be available.

<title>HTC Announces The One ME With MediaTek&#39;s Helio X10</title><article>Today the HTC One ME was officially announced in China. While it&#39;s not likely that this device will ever be sold in other markets, it&#39;s worth taking a look at to see what differences there are from the devices that HTC ships globally. Below you can see the specifications of the new HTC One MEAs you can see, this is definitely positioned as a high end device. As far as HTC&#39;s overall lineup goes, the HTC One M9 is probably the best device to make comparisons to. The most obvious difference is with the SoC. While the One M9 uses Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon 810, the One ME uses MediaTek&#39;s Helio X10 SoC. This is one of MediaTek&#39;s high end chips, and it&#39;s really only second to the recently launched Helio X20. I wouldn&#39;t want to judge how the One ME&#39;s performance compares to the One M9 based on spec sheets, but I&#39;m very interested in seeing comparisons of the two phones once the One ME gets into the hands of usersMoving on from the SoC, we see specs that mostly mirror those of the One M9. The battery capacity, cameras, RAM, and NAND are all exactly the same. The biggest specification change is to the display. While the One M9 sports a 5&quot; 1920x1080 panel, the One ME has a higher resolution 5.2&quot; 2560x1440 panel. This means that the One ME is also slightly larger and thicker than the One M9, and ever so slightly ligFor me the most interesting thing about the HTC One ME is probably the fingerprint scanner on the bottom. Whether it&#39;s a swipe style sensor like the HTC One Max or a touch and hold sensor like the iPhone is currently unknown, but having a fingerprint scanner&nbsp;at all when the One M9 doesn&#39;t is notable to say the least. I also&nbsp;like the design where&nbsp;it&#39;s set between two speaker grillesThere&#39;s currently no indication of what the HTC One ME will cost, or when it will begin shipping in China. When it does go on sale, it&#39;ll be available in rose gold, gold sepia, and black.&nbsp;It&#39;s doubtful that it&#39;ll ever be seen on North American shores, although I would love to get my hands on one.&nbspSource:HT viaGSMArToday the HTC One ME was officially announced in China.

<title>Iowa presidential election caucuses will go high tech</title><article>There are some things that are uniquely American, like apple pie, fireworks on the Fourth of July ... and the ridiculous hoopla that surrounds the Iowa caucuses, the first big electoral event in the run-up to the presidential electionOn Friday, the state’sDemocrati andRepublican partie announced a new system that will be used to count the votes cast by Iowans during the complicated election process. Authorized precinct representatives will use new apps to report results to their party headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa’s capital, when the election takes place early next yearThe system is powered by Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform and wasbuilt by the tech gian in collaboration with its partner InterKnowlogy, which also made CNN’s Magic Wall election result reporting tool. It replaces a set-up that required precinct representatives to call into automated phone systems with no way of authenticating whether the person was authorized to do so and then record votes using their phone’s keypad. Representatives also mailed paper records to the party’s central officeThat was a potentially error-prone process that led to problems. In 2012, the state Republican party initially reported that Mitt Romney won the caucuses, but ended up changing the final count after discovering problems with the votes submitted. Ittook two week for the party to resolve the errors and declare a victor, despite never receiving results from 8 of the state’s precinctsIt also ran at odds with the around-the-clock coverage of the presidential election from American media. Iowa’s primary election has been the first in the nation since 1972, which means the results are the first sign of what may be on the horizon for voters and candidates in other parts of the countryMicrosoft’s new system not only provides for easy transmission of election results, but it also allows party administrators to view results as they come in and will automatically identify potential problem areas. Election officials can then contact the precinct representative to clear anything up. It also means that tech experts will be lending their security know-how to the process, which is a good sign since the Iowa Democrats’press releas announcing the system included spammy advertisements Friday for discount pharmaceuticalsIt’s an interesting way to modernize the caucus process, which is among the quirkiest fixtures of modern American government. Each party has a different process for nominating a candidate, but one thing is constant across both: Iowans gather in a room to discuss the candidates’ relative merits, before deciding on how many delegates to send to a county-wide caucus. The Democrats’ system is particularly complicated. It involves sectioning off a room into multiple areas for supporters of different candidates, and then having those different camps try to convince their fellow voters to join a different side.

<title>The Huawei P8 Review</title><article>It&rsquo;s been a month now since Huawei launched its new smartphone flagship, the P8. Huawei started Ascend P-line of smartphones back in 2012 with the launch of the Ascend P1, and has since iterated every year with the follow up P6, P7, and this year&rsquo;s P8. A notable deviation from the standard naming scheme is that Huawei chose to drop the Ascend brand and this year&rsquo;s official name is simply the &ldquo;Huawei P8&rdquo;. The P-series targets the higher-end market through more robust and premium build quality, while the separate Honor brand is targeted at mainly the Chinese and other budget markets. The Mate family covers the phablet form-factor, although Huawei now also offers a super-sized P8max with 6.8&rdquo; screen that kind of blurs the size segmentationIn trying to broaden our coverage of emerging players in the mobile space, we had the pleasure of extensively covering two of Huawei&rsquo;s devices over the last year &ndash; theHonor  and theMate , so be sure to read those articles to have a good overview of Huawei&rsquo;s previous efforts in terms of Emotion UI software implementations and specifics of the HiSilicon Kirin The P8 succeeds the Ascend P7 &ndash; both are the 5&rdquo; form-factor devices aiming at the high-end segment. The P8 differs quite a lot from the P7 by ditching the glass back in favour of an all-metal unibody with rounded sides. The size also goes up a bit as the display continues to grow from 4.7&rdquo; and 5&rdquo; on the P6 and P7 up to 5.2&rdquo; on the P8. The device gains 3mm in width and 5.1mm in height over its predecessor, reaching dimensions of 144.9 x 71.8 x 6.4mm. The device remains still very thin at 6.4mm and thus helps its ergonomicsBefore we look closer at the design choices, let&rsquo;s go over the specifications of the P8&rsquo;s hardwareHuawei continues to use its in-house HiSilicon-designed SoCs with the use of a new Kirin 930 or 935. The SoC is a dual-cluster piece sporting a total of 8 ARM Cortex A53 CPU cores. Differing from the usual big.LITTLE implementations were the silicon vendor would choose to use two differing CPU architectures, the Kirin 930&rsquo;s use a low-frequency and leakage optimized A53 cluster paired with a high-frequency and higher leakage variant. HiSilicon calls this higher frequency core an A53e, although the piece should have no architectural differences to a traditional A53 other than an optimized physical layout to enable the higher operating frequenciesThere was some confusion as to why two SoC model numbers were referenced during the announcement of the device, but the end story seems to be is that HiSilicon brands the same piece of silicon; the Hi3635 differently based on the frequency binning it is able to reach. As such, the cheaper variants of the P8 and P8max come&nbsp;with the Kirin &ldquo;930&rdquo; with the fast A53 cluster clocked in at 2.0GHz and 16GB of NAND memory, while the more expensive models with 64GB of storage come with the Kirin &ldquo;935&rdquo; clocking in at up to 2.2GHz on its performance cluster. We&rsquo;ve already seen this practice in the Honor 6 and Mate 7, both using the same Hi3630 chipset but branded slightly differently (Kirin 920 and Kirin 925) due to the higher clocks on the latter modelOther than the CPU architecture change, the Hi3635 seems to differ very little to the Hi3630. We still see an ARM Mali T628MP4, running at slighter higher clocks of 680MHz. The memory sub-system is also again furbished by a 32-bit dual-channel LPDDR3-1600 memory controller design, which serves 3GB of total memory in all of the P8&rsquo;s models. As expected, Huawei continues to use TSMC&rsquo;s 28nm processHiSilicon first equipped an integrated modem in the Kirin 920, and the 930 continues this although with a slight downgrade in capability as it only supports UE Category 4 LTE speeds, reaching up to 150Mbps downstream and 50Mpbs upstIt&rsquo;s on the camera that Huawei has undoubtedly focused most of its attention on in the P8. We had some very harsh words for the Honor 6&rsquo;s and Mate 7&rsquo;s camera performances, as both featured very disappointing photo and video quality. The P8 looks to change this through the introduction of a brand new Sony sensor, theIMX27. This is the second kind of implementation RGBW (Or RGBC) after the OmniVision unit foundin the original Moto . Huawei also abandons on-SoC still-image processing for a dedicated Altek external ISP. To finish things off, the camera module supports two-axis optical image stabilization with up to 2&deg; of movement freedom. All these changes mark a significant upgrade for Huawei, and it seems to pay off for the P8, which we&rsquo;ll cover in more detail in the camera secGetting back to the P8&rsquo;s design, we see an evolution of the all-metal chassis which was introduced in the Mate 7. The P8 remains a unibody design with a non-removable 2680mAh (10.19Whr) battery. The front of the phone follows the traditional slab design with the 1080p screen taking up 78.3% off the front&rsquo;s footprint. It should be noted that the black frame surrounding the actual screen makes it seem as if the device&rsquo;s size-bezels are much smaller than what they really are, something which is very visible on the lighter colouredAs opposed to the left side of the device which is barren of any feature, the right side holds the volume rocker and power button as well as the ejectable trays for the nanoSIM as well as nanoSIM/microSD combo. The volume rocker is very clicky and distinguishable from the power button, which not only has a characteristic texture on it but is also surrounded by an indent differentiating itself from the otherwise round sides. Speaking of the sides, the curvature makes for a very comfortable grip which is accentuated by bevels on the front aOn the top of the device we find the 3.5mm headphone jack and the top auxiliary microphone. The bottom is more interesting as the microUSB 2.0 port is flanked by two Torx screws and two symmetrical speaker grills. I tried dismantling the device by trying to remove the screws and lifting up the device&#39;s screen, but it seems that Huawei also employs additional adhesive to hold the metal shell and the screen together.&nbspHuawei called the design a &ldquo;single audio chamber speaker system&rdquo;, but in practice the right grill is essentially just for aesthetics and only serves as a housing for the bottom microphone. Covering up the left grill will completely dampen the audio output of the device.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the P8 is&nbsp;still able to output very loud and clear audio with gooThe back of the device is accentuated by the plastic injection mold lines (which serve as dielectric dividers for the device&rsquo;s antennas) at the bottom of the phone, while the top part we see a glass piece serving both as the cover glass for the camera and design element as it continues&nbsp;for the whole width of the device, which comes in either white for the brighter coloured phone options or black for the darker variantsHuawei was proud to show off the ability to keep the camera flush with the rest of the phone. It seems they even managed to have some leeway here as the camera module seems to be still 1.5mmIn terms of build quality it seems the P8 is a solid phone. The only gripe I&rsquo;ve had with it is that it seems to have some empty space underneath the back of the phone as if you try to squeeze it will flex inwards by up to 1mm. The phone&rsquo;s ergonomics are good and it was a generally pleasant device toThe P8 is available in two variants at each price point: 499&euro; for either the 16GB Mystic Champagne or Prestige Gold versions, or 599&euro; for the 64GB Titanium Grey or Carbon Black variants which also come with the 200MHz higher CPU clockIt&rsquo;s been a month now since Huawei launched its new smartphone flagship, the P8.

Covering up the left grill will completely dampen the audio output of the device.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the P8 is&nbsp;still able to output very loud and clear audio with gooThe back of the device is accentuated by the plastic injection mold lines (which serve as dielectric dividers for the device&rsquo;s antennas) at the bottom of the phone, while the top part we see a glass piece serving both as the cover glass for the camera and design element as it continues&nbsp;for the whole width of the device, which comes in either white for the brighter coloured phone options or black for the darker variantsHuawei was proud to show off the ability to keep the camera flush with the rest of the phone. It seems they even managed to have some leeway here as the camera module seems to be still 1.5mmIn terms of build quality it seems the P8 is a solid phone. The only gripe I&rsquo;ve had with it is that it seems to have some empty space underneath the back of the phone as if you try to squeeze it will flex inwards by up to 1mm. The phone&rsquo;s ergonomics are good and it was a generally pleasant device toThe P8 is available in two variants at each price point: 499&euro; for either the 16GB Mystic Champagne or Prestige Gold versions, or 599&euro; for the 64GB Titanium Grey or Carbon Black variants which also come with the 200MHz higher CPU clocks.</articles>

The final version of Valve&rsquo;s controller is pretty much identical to what we saw at GDC 2015, featuring what has become the controller&rsquo;s signature touchpads, along with an analog stick, motion controls, haptics (vibration), and what Valve is calling dual-stage triggers, all communicating with host systems over Bluetooth. Though ultimately lacking the touchscreens of Valve&rsquo;s original design, the final controller retains the touchpads and the same goals Valve had held to since the start: making more traditional mouse-driven PC games playable on the couch with a controller. Valve has put up a short promotional video showing it in action, and it will be interesting to see if it works as well in real life as Valve would like it to. When not part of a Steam Machine bundle, Valve will beselling the Steam Controller stand-aloneNext up, this brings us to Valve&rsquo;sSteam Machines initiativ. With last year&rsquo;s delays we&rsquo;ve seen a few of the initial Steam Machines reissued as Windows machines in the interim, but now with Valve finally ready to ship on their end, thefull collection of Machines will be availabl. In terms of design all of these Machines are all small form factor designs intended for the living room, with the actual designs being a mix of existing SFF designs &ndash; such as theGigabyte BRIX Pr or theFalcon Northwest Tik &ndash; while other designs being braMeanwhile as far as performance and costs go, the initial wave of Machines run the gauntlet from low-powered, console-like computers to high-end machines that are meant to take a stab at 4K rendering. The cheapest machines start at $449, such as theAlienwar in its low-end, Core-i3 powered configuration, and also theiBuyPower SB. Meanwhile at the middle of the pack are machines like theZotac SN97 at $999, and finally at the high-end the sky&rsquo;s the limit. With many of these designs accepting desktop class CPUs and video cards, the price tag on the top configurations can go into the thousands of dollars, with Falcon Northwest quoting $4999 for what will be their top-endTikAs one might expect, all of the Steam Machines are shipping with one Steam Controller, with additional controllers available from Valve for $49.

<title>4K Displays for HTPCs: A Consumer Checklist</title><article>Getting a HTPC setup right for the 4K era has become a very confusing exercise for the consumers. We tried to clarify some aspects in ourFuture-proofing HTPCs for the 4K Era: HDMI, HDCP and HEV piece back in April. While we did touch upon the features that consumers should look for in the HDMI sinks in the setup (i.e, the HDMI ports on the TV and the AV receiver), we didn&#39;t go into detail on the characteristics of the display itselfPicture quality is of paramount importance, but it is usually not a known aspect unless one reads the after-launch reviews. However, there are some basic specifications that can help narrow down the search. Availability of 4Kp60, HDMI 2.0, HDCP 2.2 and ARC (audio return channel) support are readily available in the spec sheets of the displays coming into the market nowadays. In this piece, we will cover a few &#39;behind-the-scene&#39; aspects and how the recently launched Hisense 50H7GB fares with our checklistVideos meant for consumer consumption have always been encoded in 4:2:0 format withchroma sub-samplin. Frames encoded / sent to the display in this format are fine for viewing purposes, since the effects of the sub-sampling are not very evident in rapidly changing images. Unfortunately, HTPCs are multi-purpose devices. Even though video decode and display is probably the majority of its workload, it can be used for tasks such as web browsing also. Driving mostly-static desktop frames to the display in 4:2:0 makes for a bad user experience. For a detailed explanation, I strongly suggest that readers perusethis AVSForum threa. Usually, most displays supporting 4Kp60 RGB 4:4:4 also support the other variants - 4Kp60 4:2:0 at 8b, 10b and 12b, as well as 4Kp60 4:2:2 at 8b and 10bEnsure that any display you plan to purchase for a 4K HTPC supports 4Kp60 RGB 4:4:4 input in the HDMI 2.0 / HDCP 2.2 sinkUltra HD Blu-rays are expected to come with high-dynamic range content. HDMI 2.0a was recently ratified with support for HDR metadata flags. Most displays can get firmware upgrades if they are already HDMI 2.0 certified. However, that might not always be the case, and the consumer needs to pay particular attention to this aspectIf you are planning to watch 4K Blu-rays on your display, ensure that it supports HDR, both from the HDMI sink perspective, as well as the display perspectiveDisplay panels usually come in 8b, 10b or 12b varieties. This bit-depth refers to the number of bits used to encode each sub-pixel (color channel) that gets displayed. Very cheap panels even adopt 6b panels. Note that the input coming via, say, HDMI has a minimum bit-depth of 8b per sample. Lower bit-depth panels adopt dithering to represent higher bit-depth content. When done in a temporal manner (i.e, over time for successive frames), it is called FRC (frame rate control). Suffice to say that FRC is not something you would want in your display, since it doesn&#39;t accurately reflect what is being transferred over the display linkHigher panel bit-depth is also useful for representing a wider color gamut without banding artifacts. With the adoption of the largerBT.2020 color space for UH, it is good to have a panel with higher bit-depth compared to what one had for Full HD (the smaller BT.709 color space)In addition, 4K videos in HEVC for consumer delivery are already being encoded with the Main10 profile (4:2:0, 10b per sample). In order to accurately display such videos, it is essential that the panel bit-depth matches or exceeds 10b. Another aspect of HDMI 2.0a is HDR (high dynamic range), which we briefly covered in the earlier sub-section. This needs 10b at the minimum for each sub-pixelAll things considered, ensure that any display you plan to purchase for a 4K HTPC has a 10b (or higher) panel.

In addition, it is also important to have the ability to turn off motion interpolation to avoid soap opera effects in movies and certain other videos. The higher the coverage of the BT.2020 color gamut, the better. However, these are aspects that need to checked in the display reviewsThis article was triggered in part by the launch of the Hisense 50H7GB 50&quot; 4K TV last week. In addition to 4Kp60 support with HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2, the TV also supports 1080p120 with real 120 Hz refresh rates and carries a &quot;Netflix Recommended TV&quot; designation. All of this comes for just $598 with Wal-Mart as the main distributor. Surprisingly, the TV also carries a 4-year in-home service warranty. Most of the technical details not available in the press release have been gathered byHDGur. In addition, there is also aYouTube video revie with the TV in action. The TV is powered by the MediaTek 5657 quad-core SoCPiqued by the price to specifications balance, we contacted Hisense and got some more information that is summarized in the table below. All the components (panel, TCON, BLU and enclosure) other than the open cell glass are manufactured by HisenseBased on Hisense&#39;s response, it looks like the 50H7GB might not tick all the boxes for the perfect HTPC 4K display (given the lack of HDR capabilities). But, given the price, it is going to be hard to complain. On the other hand, support for 4Kp60 RGB 4:4:4 makes it an interesting display. At 50&quot;, it might be hard to justify calling it a monitor, but it seems to be a good candidate for connecting to computers in general (particularly for an &#39;entry-level&#39; 4K HTPC setupGetting a HTPC setup right for the 4K era has become a very confusing exercise for the consumers.

All the components (panel, TCON, BLU and enclosure) other than the open cell glass are manufactured by HisenseBased on Hisense&#39;s response, it looks like the 50H7GB might not tick all the boxes for the perfect HTPC 4K display (given the lack of HDR capabilities). But, given the price, it is going to be hard to complain. On the other hand, support for 4Kp60 RGB 4:4:4 makes it an interesting display. At 50&quot;, it might be hard to justify calling it a monitor, but it seems to be a good candidate for connecting to computers in general (particularly for an &#39;entry-level&#39; 4K HTPC setup).</articles>
<title>Windows 10 Preview Build 10130 ISOs are here—but not everyone gets them</title><article>
Microsoft released ISOs of the latest Windows 10 Preview build on Friday, but not all testers will be able to get the new build right away. 
According toMicrosoft’s Gabe Aul the ISOs for Build 10130 are out now, but the company will not release the build to “Slow ring” testers just yet “due to several bugs we’re looking to fix.”
For the uninitiated, Microsoft has two tracks for Windows 10 Preview testers: the Fast ring and the Slow ring. If you’re in the Fast ring, you get every Windows 10 Preview update through Windows Update as it becomes available. This means you’ll get the latest additions and changes to the Windows 10 Preview sooner, but it also means you’ll get more buggy builds. The Slow ring doesn’t receive new builds as frequently, the the builds it does get are generally more stable and less buggy.
Microsoft’s Aul had previously stated that the company “would only release ISOs if we push a build to the Slow ring,” but Build 10130’s lingering bugs are apparently enough of an issue that Microsoft felt compelled to hold back this ISO from Slow ring testers.
If you’re a Slow ring tester, though, you may still get Build 10130 eventually: Aul says that “once we have these fixes in hand and ready to push out to Windows Update, we’ll consider pushing Build 10130 to the Slow ring.” In the meantime, patience, grasshopper.Nick is a freelance contributor and a former editor for TechHive and PCWorld.

The company offers numerous enclosures that partially or completely neglect the ATX design guide.
